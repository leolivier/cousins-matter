## Installation
Cousins Matter has been tested on Linux and Windows 11 + WSL2. Not yet tested on MacOS.

Cousins Matter must be self hosted on your own server which can be very small (e.g. a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, a small VPS, an old laptop...). It is based on Docker, but you don't need to have a deep understanding of Docker to install it. You just have to be a bit comfortable with the command line.

See [Installation](https://cousins-matter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/)

## For users of version 1
The version 2 is quite different from the 1.x versions and you will need to apply a migration command to install the v2. See [Migration from v1 to v2](https://cousins-matter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrate-from-v1-to-v2/)
