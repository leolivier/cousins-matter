# Features

## Translations
* Comes with English and French translations
* Can be easily translated into any LTR language, see below. Not tested for RTL.

## Member Management
* Site admin can invite their cousins by email
* Anyone can request an invitation which will be emailed to the site admin who can then invite them. Invitation requests are protected by a captcha.
* Members can create "managed" members, i.e. members who are not active on the site (e.g. for small children or elderly people)
* Managed members can be activated by their managing members (e.g. when a child is old enough to be active on the site).
* Members can be imported in bulk via CSV files
* Member list can be filtered by first and last name
* Members can update their own profile and the profile of the members they manage
* A directory of members can be printed in PDF format
* Birthdays in the next 50 days can be displayed (50 can be changed in settings)

## Galleries
* All active members can create galleries and add photos to them
* Galleries can have sub galleries of any depth
* Photos can be imported in bulk using zip files. Each folder in the zip file becomes a gallery. Updates are managed
* Gallery photo display is paginated

## Forum
* Active members can create posts
* Active members can reply to other members' posts or add simple comments

## Coming soon
  * Help/faq/about
  * Classifieds from all members
  * Chat between members
  * Genealogy
  * Color Themes
  * ...

# Easiest way to run it: Docker

  * Create the appropriate directories and cd
    ```
    mkdir -p cousins-matter cousins-matter/data cousins-matter/media && cd cousins-matter
    ```
* Setup your .env configuration
  ```
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leolivier/cousins-matter/main/.env.example -o .env
  ```
  then edit `.env` to set the properties according to your context, see [Settings](#settings) below.

* Run the docker image
  ```
  docker run --name cousins-matter -p 8000:8000 -d -v ./data:/app/data -v ./.env:/app/.env -v ./media:/app/media ghcr.io/leolivier/cousins-matter
  ```
  Notes:
  1. If you are running on an arm64 platform, don't forget to add the platform option (`--platform linux/arm64`)
  2. Mounted volumes are as follows:
  * `/app/data` must be mounted on a directory where the database will be stored
  * `/app/.env` must be mounted on a file where the environment variables will be stored
  * `/app/media` must be mounted on a directory where the media files will be stored
     
## The first time only
  * Create a superuser:
  ```
  docker exec -it cousins-matter python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```
  and answer the questions, then
  * Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/profile
  * Login with the superuser account you just created
  * Complete your profile
  * **You're good to go!**

# Install from the sources
* Clone the git repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/mariocesar/cousins-matter.git
  ```
* Then cd to the created directory:
   ```
   cd cousins-matter
  ```	
* Install dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  > __It's better to do that in a pip env or a conda specific environment__

* Update your settings:
  Copy `.env.example`to `.env` and edit `.env` to set the properties according to your needs, see [Settings](#settings) below.
* Create your database
  ```
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
  
# Run it from sources
* In test/devt mode: 
  ```
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
* In production mode:
  ```
  daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 cousinsmatter.asgi:application
  ```
* Then, **only the 1rst time**:
  * Create a superuser:
  ```
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```
  and answer the questions, then
  * Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/profile
  * Login with the superuser account you just created
  * Complete your profile
  * You're good to go!
## IMPORTANT
For real production use and a good management of static and media files, you will need to put a reverse proxy in front of the server. It is generally much simpler to use docker for that as everything is pre-installed in the container (see below).
If you want to run from the sources without Docker, instead of running `daphne`, download [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/), edit `supervisord.conf` and replace:
* `/app` by the full name of the directory of the project
* `/dev/stdout`and `/dev/stderr` by some logfiles
and run from the project directory:
  ```
  sudo ./entrypoint.sh supervisord -c supervisord.conf
  ``` 
(you should be able to run it w/o sudo if you replace `/var` by an user directory in `supervisord.conf`)

# Upgrade
# Docker
Pull the latest image and restart the container
```
docker pull leolivier/cousins-matter
docker restart cousins-matter
```

## From source
Refresh sources from github, reinstall packages, migrate the database
```
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
```
then restart the daemon

# Other possible actions
## To generate a new language
```
python manage.py makemessages -l <language_code>
```
then edit the different django.po files in the locale folders and finish with:
```
python manage.py compilemessages
```
which will compile the translations

# To reset the database completely
Run `./clean_database.sh`
> __WARNING!__ To be used only in dev mode, this totally flushes the local database!
> __WARNING!__ don't use this with a Docker install!

# To create a docker image from the sources
  ```
  docker build -t cousins-matter .
  ```
