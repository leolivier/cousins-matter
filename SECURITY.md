# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest release is currently supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please report vulnerabilities by creating a [new draft security advisory](https://github.com/leolivier/cousins-matter/security/advisories) and don't use standard issues which are public and could provide informations to potential attackers.
These reports will be given the highest priority and, if accepted, will be fixed as soon as possible, taking into account developer availability.
