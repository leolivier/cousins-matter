#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that users can only delete their own
#. messages.  The English sentence is ambiguous as it could refer to deleting
#. messages in general or just deleting specific types of messages. The French
#. translation clarifies this ambiguity by specifying "tes propres messages",
#. which means "your own messages".

#. ways. It could mean to create a physical space, like a room in a house, or

#. Explanation:  The French translation, "Administrateurs du salon privé," is

#. context.

msgid "Back to room"
msgstr "Zurück zum Raum"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Quitter les admins de ce salon,"
#. suggests that the users should leave the administrators in the specific
#. room.  The German translation maintains this meaning by using the phrase
#. "Verlassen Sie die Admins dieses Raumes."
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:21
msgid "Leave admins of this room"
msgstr "Verlassen Sie die Verwalter dieses Raums"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Ajouter un administrateur au salon,"
#. indicates that an administrator is being added to a room.  The German

#. of adding an administrator to a specific space.

msgid "Add admin to the room"
msgstr "Fügt Verwalter dem Raum hinzu"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Enlever l'administrateur du salon,"

msgid "Members of \"%(room_name)s\" private room"
msgstr "Mitglieder des privaten Raumes '%(room_name)s'"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Quitter ce salon," means "leave this
#. room."  The German translation, "Gehen Sie diesen Raum aus," uses the verb
#. "gehen" (to go) and "Raum" (room). This accurately conveys the meaning of
#. the original sentence.

msgid "Leave this room"
msgstr "Verlasse diesen Raum"

#. Explanation:  The French translation "Ajouter un membre au salon" means

#. Raum hinzu" translates this meaning literally, using the same words and
#. structure.
#. Let me know if you have any other sentences you'd like me to translate!
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:30
msgid "Add member to the room"
msgstr "Fügt Mitglied dem Raum hinzu"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. English and French sentences.  The word "Raumlichkeiten" is a more formal
#. way to say "room" in German, which makes sense given the context of
#. removing a member from a room.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:47
msgid "Remove Member from Room"
msgstr "Entfernt den Mitglied aus der Räum"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Let's chat!" translates to "Discutons!" in
#. French. This is a direct and informal way of saying "Let's talk."  The
#. German translation maintains the same casual tone as the French
#. translation, conveying the intent to engage in conversation.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:19
msgid "Let's chat!"
msgstr "Lass uns reden!"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. English and French sentences. It uses a clear and concise language to
#. convey the intended message.  The use of "Drücken Sie die Taste" for "hit
#. return" and "Escape" for "escape" is consistent with the original
#. sentence's context and avoids ambiguity.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:28
msgid "hit return to submit, escape to give up"
msgstr "Mit Return abschicken, mit Escape abbrechen"

#. Explanation:  In the context of the provided sentences, both English and
#. French translations are clear. The word "Delete" in English is a direct
#. synonym for "Supprimer" in French. Therefore, the German translation
#. "Löschen" accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:38
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:82
msgid "Delete"
msgstr "Löschen"

#. Explanation:  Both "Edit" and "Modifier" mean to make changes. While "Edit"
#. is more common in the English language, "Modifier" is a direct and accurate
#. translation for "Edit" in this context.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:41

#. Explanation: The English word "message" is a direct translation of the
#. French word "message".  Both words refer to a communication or piece of

#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:92
msgid "Message"
msgstr "Nachricht"

#. Explanation: The English word "Submit" can have different meanings
#. depending on the context.  In this case, it is most likely referring to
#. submitting something electronically or formally. "Envoyer" in French
#. translates to "to send" which aligns with the meaning of "submit".
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:97
msgid "Submit"
msgstr "Absenden"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Room deletion" is a bit ambiguous.  The
#. French translation, "Suppression du salon," directly translates to "Salon
#. removal." This accurately reflects the meaning of the English phrase and
#. avoids any potential ambiguity.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:106
msgid "Room deletion"
msgstr "Raum löschen"

#. Explanation: The French translation is ambiguous and doesn't clearly convey
#. the meaning of the English sentence.  The German translation aims to
#. clarify the context by using "Weist du..." which means "Do you know...?" or
#. "Are you sure...?" This phrase helps to emphasize the decision-making
#. process involved in deleting a room and its messages.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:107
#, python-format

"messages?"
msgstr ""

#. Explanation: The provided placeholders are part of a specific format and

#. the French translation, including the use of "ein weiterer Raum" to
#. indicate a different room. It also uses the placeholder "{room_name}" in
#. the German translation as well.

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the person was removed from the room.
#. The English phrase " %s has been removed from the room" can be ambiguous,
#. as it can mean both "removing a person" and "removing something"
#. colloquially. The French translation makes it clear that it is a removal of
#. a person, so the German version "s wurde aus dem Raum entfernt" follows
#. this interpretation.

msgid "%s has been removed from the room"
msgstr "%s wurde aus dem Raum entfernt"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that only members of a private room can
#. become administrators.  The English sentence is ambiguous as it could refer
#. to either giving access or being an admin. The French translation clarifies
#. this ambiguity by specifying "Admins" and "Mitglieder".
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:217 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:450
msgid "Only members of this private room can become admins"
msgstr "Nur Mitglieder dieses privaten Raums können Admins werden"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French text while maintaining the original sentence structure and tone.
#. The use of "Dieser Mitglied" (this member) is a direct translation of "Ce
#. membre," and "im privaten Raum" translates to "in this private room."

"This member is the only one in this private room. Please add another one "
"before removing this one."
msgstr ""
"Dieser Mitglied ist der einzige im privaten Raum. Bitte füge einen anderen "
"hinzu, bevor du diesen entfernt."

#. Explanation: The French translation clarifies the meaning of the English
#. sentence by specifying that "you are the only member" and then adding a
#. further instruction to add another person before leaving the room.  The
#. German translation maintains this nuance while using appropriate
#. grammatical structures for clarity.

"removing yourself."
msgstr ""
"Du bist der einzige Mitglied in diesem privaten Raum. Bitte füge noch eine "
"weitere Person hinzu, bevor du dich verlässt."

#. Explanation: The French translation clarifies the meaning of the English
#. sentence by specifying that only one admin is allowed in the private room
#. and that if they leave, no other members will be left behind.  The German
#. translation maintains this clarity and uses a more formal tone to match the
#. context.

"verlässt, werden keine anderen Mitglieder zurückgelassen. Bitte füge "
"einen anderen Admin hinzu, bevor du den Raum verslässt."

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Tu as quité le salon," implies that
#. the person left a specific room.  The German translation, "Du hast die Raum
#. verlassen," captures this meaning by using the correct grammatical
#. structure and word choice to convey the same idea.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:320 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:383
msgid "You have left the room"
msgstr "Du hast die Raum verlassen."

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which states that the person is not a member of the
#. specified private room.  The use of "du" for "you" and "kein Mitglied" for
#. "not a member" maintains consistency with the original sentence's tone and
#. structure.

#. Explanation: The English word "follow" can have multiple meanings, but in
#. this context it is likely referring to the act of pursuing or tracking
#. something.  The French translation "Suivre" directly translates to "to
#. follow" and captures the meaning of the original sentence.
#: chat/tests/tests_public.py:23 chat/tests/tests_public.py:66
msgid "Follow"
msgstr "Folgen"

#. Explanation: The provided English and French translations are both
#. placeholder phrases.  The placeholders "**(nfollowers)**" represent a
#. variable that will be replaced with the actual number of followers in the
#. context of the sentence. In German, we would simply replace these
#. placeholders with their corresponding values.

#. ('{similar_room.name}')".  The German translation maintains this clarity
#. and uses a more direct phrasing to convey the same meaning as the French
#. translation.

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Méthode non autorisée,"  means
