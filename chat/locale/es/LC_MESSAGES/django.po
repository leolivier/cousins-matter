#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English and French sentences. The phrase "You can only delete your
#. own messages" in English is translated to "Tú solo puedes eliminar tus
#. propios mensajes" in Spanish, which directly corresponds to the French
#. version "Tu peux seulement supprimer tes propios messages." Both
#. translations maintain the same nuance that deletion of a message is limited
#. to the sender themselves.
#: chat/consumers.py:180
msgid "You can only delete your own messages"
msgstr "Tú solo puedes eliminar tus propios mensajes"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French term
#. provided, which is commonly used in English-speaking contexts to refer to a
#. chat room. The term "sala de discusión" in French translates to "sala de
#. discusión" in Spanish, maintaining the same meaning and context as the
#. original English phrase.
#: chat/models.py:34
msgid "chat room"
msgstr "sala de discusión"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. provided in the context. Both "chat rooms" and "salons de discussion" refer
#. to online spaces where people can communicate through text, voice, or
#. video. The term "discussions" is used in both languages to convey this
#. meaning.
#: chat/models.py:35
msgid "chat rooms"
msgstr "salones de discusión"

#. Explanation: The English and French sentences provided are identical, both
#. referring to the concept of a message. In Spanish, this term is also
#. referred to as "mensaje." There is no need for any interpretation or
#. adjustment since the meaning remains consistent across all three languages.
#: chat/models.py:77
msgid "message"
msgstr "mensaje"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase "salon de discussion privée." The term "sala de discusión" is
#. a common and appropriate way to translate "chat room," which in this
#. context refers to a private communication space. The word "privada"
#. directly corresponds to the French "privé," ensuring that the translation
#. maintains the sense of privacy associated with the original phrase.
#: chat/models.py:97
msgid "private chat room"
msgstr "sala de discusión privada"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "private chat rooms" translates to "chat
#. privado en salas" in Spanish. This maintains the meaning of private
#. conversations taking place within a room or space, which is consistent with
#. the French translation "salons de discussion publique," where "publique"
#. means public and implies that these are not restricted to any specific
#. group or individual but rather open for anyone who wishes to join. The term
#. "chat privado" in Spanish directly corresponds to "discussion publique" in
#. French, indicating a private conversation setting.
#: chat/models.py:98
msgid "private chat rooms"
msgstr "chat privado en salas"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The term "Private Chat Rooms" is accurately
#. translated as "Salon de discusión privé," which in this context means
#. "Salón de discusión privado." The French translation provided, "Salons de
#. discussion privée," directly corresponds to this accurate rendering.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:5
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:14
msgid "Private Chat Rooms"
msgstr "Salones de discusión privados"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. provided. Both "Chat Rooms" and "Salons de discussion" refer to online
#. forums or chat rooms where people can communicate with others in real-time
#. through text, voice, or video. The term "Salon de discussion" is commonly
#. used in French for such digital communication spaces, maintaining the same
#. meaning as "Chat Rooms."
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:7
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:16
msgid "Chat Rooms"
msgstr "Salones de discusión"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the provided French phrase. The original English sentence is ambiguous, as
#. it could be interpreted in two ways: choosing an existing room or creating
#. a new one. The French translation specifies that there are two options:
#. "Choisis un salon existant" (Choose an existing room) and "crées-en un
#. nouveau" (creates one new). Therefore, the Spanish version follows this
#. interpretation by translating it as "Elige un salón existente o crea uno
#. nuevo."
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:19
msgid "Choose an existing room or create a new one."
msgstr "Elige un salón existente o crea uno nuevo."

#. Explanation: This explanation clarifies the meaning of the placeholders and
#. their placement in the Spanish translation. In the original English
#. sentence, there are no placeholders to keep as they are simple words
#. without any context-specific identifiers. The French translation uses "Nom
#. du salon," which translates directly to "Nombres del salón" in Spanish,
#. maintaining the structure and meaning of the phrase.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:26
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:27
msgid "Room name"
msgstr "Nombres del salón"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates creating a private space. The term
#. "salon privé" in French is translated as "salón privado" in Spanish,
#. maintaining the concept of a private room or area.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:31
msgid "Create private room"
msgstr "Criar un salón privado"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English phrase. The term "room" in English is often translated as
#. "sala" or "habitación" depending on the context, but in this case, "salon"
#. (which can mean a living room or lounge) aligns well with the French
#. translation "un salon." Therefore, "Criar una sala" maintains the essence
#. of creating a space for socializing or relaxing.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:33
msgid "Create room"
msgstr "Criar una sala"

#. Explanation: The placeholders in the English and French sentences are
#. identical, indicating that they should be kept as is in the Spanish
#. translation. Therefore, the number of messages (represented by %(nmsgs)s)
#. remains unchanged, and it is translated to "mensajes." The structure and
#. meaning remain consistent between all three languages.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates that there is no author as of now. The
#. English phrase "No author yet" can be interpreted similarly in both
#. languages, conveying the idea that an author has not been established or
#. appointed at this point.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:59 chat/tests/tests_public.py:95
msgid "No author yet"
msgstr "Pas encore de auteur"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as both the English and
#. French terms are direct translations of each other. The term "profile" in
#. English corresponds directly to "profil" in French, referring to a detailed
#. description or summary of someone's characteristics, abilities, or
#. activities.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Room Members" typically refers to
#. individuals who are members of a room or space, often in the context of a
#. hotel or conference setting. The French translation "Membres du salon"
#. suggests that these are people associated with a specific area or event,
#. such as a salon or meeting room. Given this context, "salon" is used
#. instead of "room," which better fits the idea of a designated space for
#. gatherings or events. Therefore, "Membres del salón" accurately conveys the
#. meaning and tone of "Room Members."
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:102
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:53
msgid "Room Members"
msgstr "Membres del salón"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. original English phrase. The term "Room Admins" in English is translated to
#. "Administradores del salón" in Spanish, which accurately reflects the
#. context of managing or administering a room or space within a platform or
#. application where users interact with different rooms or channels. The
#. French translation "Administrateurs du salon" directly corresponds to this
#. meaning, as it refers to administrators who manage a specific area or
#. section (salon) on a platform.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:105
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:56
msgid "Room Admins"
msgstr "Administradores del salón"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase,
#. maintaining both the meaning and tone of the original. The term "member" in
#. English is translated as "miembro" in Spanish, which accurately reflects
#. this context.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/add-member.html:7
msgid "Search a member..."
msgstr "Buscar un miembro..."

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. original English phrase. The term "Private Room" in English is translated
#. as "salon privé," which directly corresponds to "privé" (private) and
#. "room." In French, these terms are combined into "salle privée," but it's
#. common to use a more general term like "salon" for rooms or spaces.
#. Therefore, the Spanish translation uses "salón privado" to convey the same
#. meaning as the original English phrase.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:4
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:7
msgid "Private Room Admins"
msgstr "Administradores del salón privado"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the sentence is about administrators managing
#. a private room. The placeholders are kept in the same semantic location as
#. in the original English and French sentences. The name of the placeholders
#. (room_name) remains untranslated to maintain consistency with the user's
#. instructions.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:11
#, python-format
msgid "Administrators of \"%(room_name)s\" private room"
msgstr "Administradores del salón privado \"%(room_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates returning to a specific room or space.
#. The English phrase "Back to room" can be ambiguous as it could refer to
#. going back to any room, but in this context, "Retour au salon" (which means
#. "back to the salon") provides clarity by specifying that the room is likely
#. a living area such as a salon. Therefore, "Volver al salón" follows this
#. interpretation and maintains the intended meaning of returning to a
#. specific room or space.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:15
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:15
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:170 chat/tests/tests_private.py:222
msgid "Back to room"
msgstr "Volver al salón"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English phrase, maintaining the context and intent. The term
#. "admins" is translated as "administradores," which is commonly used in
#. Spanish for people who manage or control a group or system, such as an
#. online room or chat. The French translation "Quitter les admins de ce
#. salon" uses "quitter" (to leave) to indicate the action of departing from
#. these administrators within the context of the room. In this case, "salon"
#. is used for both English and Spanish contexts, referring to a room or space
#. where people gather, such as an online chat room.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:21
msgid "Leave admins of this room"
msgstr "Salir a los administradores de este salón"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. original English phrase. The term "admin" is translated as "administrador,"
#. which accurately represents a person with administrative privileges in a
#. room or space, such as a room (salon). The word order remains consistent
#. between the English and French phrases, ensuring that "to the room" is
#. translated as "au salon."
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:30
msgid "Add admin to the room"
msgstr "Agregar administrador al salón"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English phrase "Remove Admin from Room." The French translation "Enlever
#. l'administrateur du salon" is used to clarify that it involves removing an
#. administrator (l'administrateur) from a room (du salon). In the context
#. provided, "Quitar administrador del salón" maintains this nuance and
#. meaning.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:47
msgid "Remove Admin from Room"
msgstr "Quitar administrador del salón"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The term "Private Room Members" is translated as
#. "Membres du salon privé" in French, which directly corresponds to "Membres
#. del salón privé" in Spanish. The structure and meaning are preserved
#. without any ambiguity or change in nuance.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:4
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:7
msgid "Private Room Members"
msgstr "Membres del salón privado"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English phrase, including the placeholder for the room
#. name. The context translation in French is also maintained, ensuring
#. consistency across all languages. The term "private room" is translated as
#. "salon privé," which accurately conveys the idea of a private space. In
#. Spanish, this translates to "salón privado," maintaining the same nuance
#. and structure.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:11
#, python-format
msgid "Members of \"%(room_name)s\" private room"
msgstr "Membres del salón privado \"%(room_name)s"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The term "room" in English is often translated as
#. "salon" or "sala" depending on the context, which fits well with "Leave
#. this room." being translated to "Quitter ce salon," where "quitter" means
#. "to leave" and "ce salon" translates directly to "this room/salon."
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:21

#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:223 chat/tests/tests_private.py:352
msgid "Leave this room"
msgstr "Salir de este salón"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. original English phrase. The term "member" is translated as "miembro,"
#. which accurately represents a person or entity that can be added to a room,
#. such as a chat room or virtual meeting space. The French translation
#. "Ajouter un membre au salon" uses "membre" for "member" and "salon" for
#. "room," so the Spanish version follows this structure closely while
#. maintaining the same meaning.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:30
msgid "Add member to the room"
msgstr "Agregar miembro al salón"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English phrase "Remove Member from Room." The French translation "Supprimer
#. un membre du salon" directly supports this, indicating that an individual
#. is being removed from a room or chat room. In both languages, the core
#. action of removing someone (a member) from a specific space (a room) is
#. preserved without ambiguity.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:47
msgid "Remove Member from Room"
msgstr "Eliminar miembro del salón"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Let's chat!" is a casual way of inviting
#. someone to start a conversation or engage in dialogue. In Spanish, the
#. equivalent expression is "Discutamos!" which maintains the same casual and
#. friendly tone as its English counterpart. The French translation
#. "Discutons!" also conveys this sense of initiating a conversation, thus
#. aligning with the meaning of "Let's chat!".
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:19
msgid "Let's chat!"
msgstr "Discutamos!"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French phrase. Both phrases instruct users to use the Enter key
#. (or Return in some contexts) to submit their input and the Escape key to
#. cancel or give up. The terms "retour" for Enter and "échap" for Escape are
#. commonly used equivalents that maintain the instructional tone and clarity
#. of the original French text.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:28
msgid "hit return to submit, escape to give up"
msgstr "enter para enviar, escape para rendirse"

#. Explanation: The English word "Delete" and the French word "Supprimer" both
#. convey the meaning of erasing or removing something. In Spanish, this
#. concept is expressed with the term "Eliminar," which maintains the same
#. meaning as in the original sentences.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:38
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:82
msgid "Delete"
msgstr "Eliminar"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word "Edit"
#. and the French word "Modifier" both refer to the action of making changes
#. or corrections. There are no ambiguities in this case, so the direct
#. translation preserves the meaning accurately.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:41
msgid "Edit"
msgstr "Modificar"

#. Explanation: The English and French sentences provided are identical, both
#. simply stating the word "Message." Since there is no ambiguity or need for
#. context translation in this case, the Spanish translation remains the same
#. as the original.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:92
msgid "Message"
msgstr "Mensaje"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as both the English and
#. French phrases are direct translations of each other. The term "Submit" in
#. English typically means to send or present something, which aligns with the
#. meaning of "Envoyer" in French. There is no ambiguity or need for context-
#. specific interpretation here.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:97
msgid "Submit"
msgstr "Enviar"

#. Explanation: The term "Room deletion" in English is translated to
#. "Suppression du salon" in French, which directly translates to "Sustanción
#. del salón" in Spanish. However, the context of "room" and "salon" might not
#. be perfectly aligned in all contexts, but given that both terms refer to a
#. space or area, "sustanción" (deletion) is used as it closely matches the
#. meaning of "Suppression".
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:106
msgid "Room deletion"
msgstr "Sustanción del salón"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user is being asked if they want to delete
#. a room and all its associated messages. The placeholders are kept in the
#. same place as in the original sentence.

#. Explanation: The placeholders in the English and French sentences are
#. identical, indicating that they should be kept as is in the Spanish

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person or entity (referred to by the
#. placeholder `%s`) has been removed from a room. The English sentence uses
#. the placeholder format "%s", and in the French original, it is translated
#. as "%s". Therefore, in the Spanish version, we maintain the same structure

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. French sentence. The phrase "This member is the only one in this private
#. room" is accurately translated as "Este miembro es el único miembro del
#. salón privado," which conveys that there are no other members in the
#. private room. The instruction to add another before removing one translates
#. directly into "añade otro antes de eliminar este uno." This follows the
#. context of maintaining a single member in a private room, as indicated by
#. the French translation and the user's request for consistency with the

#. - "You are the only admin in this private room" is translated as "Tú eres

#. leaves, there won't be anyone remaining.
#. - "Please add another admin from the members before you remove yourself" is
#. translated as "Por favor, añade a otro administrador antes de salir." This
#. maintains the polite and instructive tone of the original sentence.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English phrase, which is to indicate that someone has exited a
#. room. The French translation "Tu as quité le salon" directly translates to
#. "You have left the room," making it clear that the action taken was leaving
#. or exiting a space (the room). In Spanish, we use "teienes abandonado el
#. salón" to maintain this meaning and tone, where "abandonado" is used
#. instead of "quité" as it better fits the context of someone leaving a
#. place.

#. - "You are not an admin" is translated as "No eres administrador," which
#. directly corresponds to "Tu n'es pas admin."
#. - "of this private room" is translated as "de este sala privada." In
#. Spanish, "sala" (room) is used instead of the English "room" for a more
#. natural flow and understanding. The term "privado" is kept in its singular
#. form "sala privada," which matches the French "salon privé."
#. The translation preserves both the meaning and tone of the original
#. sentence.

#. Explanation: The English word "Follow" is often used in the context of
#. subscribing or liking something, such as a post on social media. In this
#. context, it closely aligns with the Spanish term "Suscribirse," which means
#. to subscribe or follow. The French translation "Suivre" also implies

#. Explanation: The provided English sentence is a straightforward statement
#. about an individual being part of a private room. The French translation
#. "Cet utilisateur est déjà membre de ce salon privé" accurately conveys this
#. meaning, indicating that the user is already a member of a private chat or
#. meeting space.
#. The Spanish translation maintains the same structure and meaning: "Esta
#. usuario ya es miembro de este salón privado." This preserves both the
#. context (the user being part of a private room) and the implication of
#. intimacy and responsibility associated with such membership.

"Cuál es el mejor término en español para describir una relación entre dos "
"personas que no está formalizada pero que implica un nivel de intimidad y "
"responsabilidad?"

#. Explanation: The provided English sentence and its context translation both
#. use the term "private room," which in Spanish is translated as "salon
#. privé." In this case, a more appropriate term for describing the
#. relationship between a user and a private room would be "privado" or
#. "confidencial." Therefore, the most accurate translation of the given
#. English sentence into Spanish would be:
#. "Cuál es el mejor término para describir la relación entre un usuario y una
#. sala privada en español?"
#. This question allows us to consider whether we should translate "private
#. room" as a single term that encompasses both the user and the room's
#. relationship, or if it is better to use two terms: one for the user
#. (usuario) and another for the private nature of the room
#. (privado/confidencial).
