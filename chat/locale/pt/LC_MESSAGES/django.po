#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user can only delete their own messages.
#. The English sentence is clear and direct about this limitation, so the
#. Portuguese version follows a similar tone and clarity.
#: chat/consumers.py:180
msgid "You can only delete your own messages"
msgstr "Você pode apenas apagar seus próprios mensagens."

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same meaning and
#. connotation as the original English phrase, using the word "salão" to
#. convey a sense of informal gathering or meeting place.
#: chat/models.py:34
msgid "chat room"
msgstr "Salão de chat"

#. Explanation: The English term "chat rooms" refers to online spaces for
#. real-time text-based communication. The French translation "salons de
#. discussion" conveys a similar meaning, emphasizing the social aspect of
#. these online spaces. In Portuguese, this translation is maintained as
#. "salões de discussão".
#: chat/models.py:35
msgid "chat rooms"
msgstr "Salões de discussão"

#. Explanation: The English and French translations are identical, so the
#. Portuguese translation is also a direct copy of the original.
#: chat/models.py:77
msgid "message"
msgstr "mensagem"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "private chat room" can be ambiguous, as it
#. can refer to a private conversation or a private space. The French
#. translation "salon de discussion privée" makes it clear that it is a
#. private space for discussion, which is the most common interpretation in
#. this context. In Portuguese, we use the term "salão" to refer to a room or
#. a space, and "conversação privada" to indicate that it's a private
#. conversation.
#: chat/models.py:97
msgid "private chat room"
msgstr "Salão de conversação privado"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "private chat rooms" indicates that the
#. rooms are for personal, private conversations. In contrast, the French
#. phrase "salons de discussion publique" suggests public discussion areas,
#. which is not what the original English sentence intended to convey.
#. Therefore, the Portuguese translation "Salas privadas" maintains
#. consistency with the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
#: chat/models.py:98
msgid "private chat rooms"
msgstr "Salas privadas"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates private chat rooms. The English phrase is
#. straightforward and clear in its intention, so the Portuguese version
#. follows this interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:5
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:14
msgid "Private Chat Rooms"
msgstr "Salas de conversação privadas"

#. Explanation: The English term "Chat Rooms" refers to online spaces where
#. people can engage in real-time conversations. The French translation
#. "Salons de discussion" accurately conveys this meaning, emphasizing the
#. social and interactive aspect of these virtual spaces. In Portuguese, the
#. translation "Salas de discussão" maintains the same nuance, suggesting a
#. space for conversation and interaction among users.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:7
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:16
msgid "Chat Rooms"
msgstr "Salas de discussão"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is clear and direct. The English sentence provides two
#. options for the user to choose from, while the French translation maintains
#. this clarity by using the verb "crées-en" (to create) in a way that implies
#. creating a new room.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:19
msgid "Choose an existing room or create a new one."
msgstr "Escolha uma sala existente ou crie uma nova."

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same structure and
#. meaning as the French original, indicating the name of a room.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:26
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:27
msgid "Room name"
msgstr "Nome do salão"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates creating a private room. The English phrase "Create
#. private room" is straightforward and clear in its intention, so the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:31
msgid "Create private room"
msgstr "Criar uma sala privada"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates creating a new space or room. The English phrase
#. "Create room" is more general and can be interpreted in different ways, but
#. the French translation makes it clear that it's about creating a specific
#. type of space (un salon).
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:33
msgid "Create room"
msgstr "Criar uma sala"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "%(nmsgs)s message" is likely a placeholder
#. for a variable that represents the number of messages, and the Portuguese
#. translation "mensagem" means "message". Since the French translation is
#. identical to the original, it's clear that the meaning remains the same.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:47 chat/tests/tests_private.py:46

#, python-format
msgid "%(nmsgs)s message"
msgid_plural "%(nmsgs)s messages"
msgstr[0] "%(nmsgs)s mensagem"
msgstr[1] "%(nmsgs)s mensagens"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that there is no author yet. The English phrase "No
#. author yet" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "there is no author" and
#. "the author has not been found yet". However, in this context, the phrase
#. implies that there is still a need to find or assign an author, making the
#. Portuguese translation "Não há autor ainda" more accurate.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:59 chat/tests/tests_public.py:95
msgid "No author yet"
msgstr "Não há autor ainda"

#. Explanation: The English word "profile" and the French word "profil" both
#. refer to a person's or thing's outline or characteristics, often used in
#. contexts like social media profiles.

#: chat/tests/tests_public.py:67
msgid "profile"
msgstr "Perfil"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the members are part of a specific room or
#. area. The English phrase "Room Members" is more general and could refer to
#. any type of membership, whereas the French translation makes it clear that
#. it is a specific group within a room.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:102
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:53
msgid "Room Members"
msgstr "Membros do quarto"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the administrators are responsible for the
#. room. The English phrase "Room Admins" is a common abbreviation used to
#. refer to individuals who manage or oversee a specific room or area. The
#. Portuguese version "Administradores do quarto" follows this interpretation
#. and maintains consistency with the French translation.
#: chat/templates/chat/chat_rooms.html:105
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:56
msgid "Room Admins"
msgstr "Administradores do quarto"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Search a member" can be ambiguous, as it
#. could mean both searching for someone and also referring to the act of
#. finding or discovering something. However, in this context, where the
#. French translation is "Rechercher un membre", which implies looking for a
#. specific person or entity, the Portuguese translation "Procurar um membro"
#. follows this interpretation, suggesting a search for a member within a
#. group or organization.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/add-member.html:7
msgid "Search a member..."
msgstr "Procurar um membro..."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which specifically mentions the private room. The English phrase
#. "Private Room Admins" is more general and could refer to any type of
#. administration or management role in a private setting. The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is about the administrators of a
#. specific private room, so the Portuguese version follows this
#. interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:4
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:7
msgid "Private Room Admins"
msgstr "Administração de Sala Privada"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that it is a private room. The English phrase
#. "Administrators of '%(room_name)s' private room" can be ambiguous, as it
#. could refer to any type of private space. However, the French translation
#. makes it clear that it is a specific type of private room, so the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:11
#, python-format
msgid "Administrators of \"%(room_name)s\" private room"
msgstr "Administrações de '%(room_name)s' sala privada"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a return to a specific room. The English phrase
#. "Back to room" can be ambiguous, as it could refer to returning to any
#. room. The French translation makes it clear that it is a return to a
#. specific room, so the Portuguese version "Volto ao quarto" follows this
#. interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:15
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:15
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:170 chat/tests/tests_private.py:222
msgid "Back to room"
msgstr "Volto ao quarto"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user wants to remove or leave the
#. administrators of a specific room. The English sentence is clear and
#. direct, while the French translation makes it explicit. In Portuguese,
#. "deixar" means to leave or remove, and "administradores" refers
#. specifically to the people in charge of managing a space or system.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:21
msgid "Leave admins of this room"
msgstr "Deixe os administradores desse salão"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates adding an administrator to a room. The English
#. phrase "Add admin to the room" is clear and direct, so the Portuguese
#. version follows this interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:30
msgid "Add admin to the room"
msgstr "Adicionar um administrador ao salão"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates removing the administrator from the room. The
#. English phrase "Remove Admin from Room" is clear and direct, so the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_admins.html:47
msgid "Remove Admin from Room"
msgstr "Remova o administrador do quarto."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a private room or space. The English phrase
#. "Private Room Members" can be ambiguous, as it could refer to members of a
#. private club or organization, but in this context, it seems to indicate
#. that the individuals are part of a private room or space, possibly for a
#. specific event or gathering.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:4
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:7
msgid "Private Room Members"
msgstr "Membros do quarto privado"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a private room. The English phrase "Members of
#. "%(room_name)s" private room" can be ambiguous, as it refers to a specific
#. group of people in a private space. The French translation makes it clear
#. that it is a private room, so the Portuguese version "sala privada" follows
#. this interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:11
#, python-format
msgid "Members of \"%(room_name)s\" private room"
msgstr "Membros do quarto privado \"%(room_name)s\""

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person should leave the current room. The
#. English phrase "Leave this room" is direct and clear, so the Portuguese
#. version follows a similar tone and intention.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:21
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:47 chat/tests/tests_private.py:171
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:223 chat/tests/tests_private.py:352
msgid "Leave this room"
msgstr "Deixe este sala."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates adding a new member to the room. The English phrase
#. "Add member to the room" is clear and direct, so the Portuguese version
#. follows this interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:30
msgid "Add member to the room"
msgstr "Adicionar um membro à sala"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates removing a member from a room. The English phrase
#. "Remove Member from Room" is clear and direct, so the Portuguese version
#. follows this interpretation.
#: chat/templates/chat/private/room_members.html:47
msgid "Remove Member from Room"
msgstr "Remover Membro de Sala"

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the informal and friendly
#. tone of the original English sentence, using the phrase "Vamos conversar"
#. which is a common way to invite someone to talk or chat.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:19
msgid "Let's chat!"
msgstr "Vamos conversar!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that pressing Return is used to submit and pressing
#. Escape is used to give up. The English phrase "hit return to submit, escape
#. to give up" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both submitting a form or
#. giving up on an activity.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:28
msgid "hit return to submit, escape to give up"
msgstr "Pressione Enter para enviar, pressione Esc para desistir"

#. Explanation: The English word "Delete" can have different meanings
#. depending on the context, such as deleting a file or deleting an account.
#. However, in general, it means to remove or get rid of something. The
#. Portuguese translation "Apagar" is more neutral and can be used in various
#. contexts, including removing files, accounts, or even deleting a task.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:38
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:82
msgid "Delete"
msgstr "Apagar"

#. Explanation: This translation reflects the meaning of the French phrase,
#. which is to modify or change something. The English word "Edit" can also
#. refer to a process of reviewing and revising written content, but in this
#. context, both translations are suitable.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:41
msgid "Edit"
msgstr "Editar"

#. Explanation: The English and French translations are identical, so the
#. Portuguese translation is also a direct copy.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:92
msgid "Message"
msgstr "mensagem"

#. Explanation: The English word "Submit" can have different meanings
#. depending on the context, such as to send or to agree with. However, in
#. this case, considering the French translation "Envoyer", which means "to
#. send", the Portuguese translation "Enviar" is consistent and accurate for
#. the context of submitting something, likely a form or document.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:97
msgid "Submit"
msgstr "Enviar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a deliberate removal or erasure of the room. The
#. English phrase "Room deletion" is concise and direct, implying a technical
#. or administrative action to remove the room from existence or availability.
#. The French translation "Suppression du salon" conveys a similar idea,
#. suggesting a formal or official process of removing the room.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:106
msgid "Room deletion"
msgstr "Remoção de sala."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is asking if you are sure to delete a specific room and all
#. its associated messages. The English sentence uses a placeholder for the
#. room name, while the French translation includes it directly. The
#. Portuguese version follows this format, keeping the placeholder in the same
#. location as in the original sentence.
#: chat/templates/chat/room_detail.html:107
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Are you sure you want to delete the room \"%(room_name)s\" and all its "
"messages?"
msgstr ""
"Você está seguro de querer apagar a sala '%(room_name)s' e todas as "
"mensagens?"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "%(nfollowers)s member" is likely referring
#. to a "member" of the followers, implying that the follower count is being
#. used as an adjective. In Portuguese, this meaning is preserved with the
#. translation "%s membro", which maintains the noun "membro" (meaning
#. "member") and uses it in the context of the follower count.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:47
#, python-format
msgid "%(nfollowers)s member"
msgid_plural "%(nfollowers)s members"
msgstr[0] "%(nfollowers)s membro"
msgstr[1] "%(nfollowers)s membros"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that another room with a similar name already
#. exists and asks to choose a different one. The English sentence is slightly
#. rephrased for better clarity, but the overall message remains the same.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:129 chat/tests/tests_public.py:55

"escolha um nome diferente."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person was physically removed from the
#. room. The English sentence "has been removed" implies a removal action,
#. while the French and Portuguese translations use the verb "remover", which
#. also conveys this idea.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:207 chat/tests/tests_private.py:283
#: chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:333
#, python-format
msgid "%s has been removed from the room"
msgstr "%s foi removido do salão."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that only members of a private room can become
#. administrators. The English sentence is clear and direct about the
#. exclusivity of membership to access admin privileges.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:217 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:450
msgid "Only members of this private room can become admins"
msgstr ""
"Somente os membros deste quarto privado podem se tornar administradores."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that there is only one member in a private room and
#. asks to add another one before removing the current one.

msgid ""
"This member is the only one in this private room. Please add another one "
"before removing this one."
msgstr ""
"Este membro é o único em este sala privada. Por favor, adicione outro antes "
"de remover este."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is the only member in a private
#. room and needs to add another one before leaving. The English sentence can
#. be ambiguous, as it uses colloquial expressions like "member" and "remove
#. yourself", whereas the French translation makes it clear that it's about
#. being the only person in a private space.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:300 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:372
msgid ""
"You are the only member in this private room. Please add another one before "
"removing yourself."
msgstr ""
"Você é o único membro nesse sala privada. Por favor, adicione outro antes de"
" se retirar."

#. Explanation: This translation reflects the meaning of the French phrase,
#. which indicates that there is only one administrator in the private room
#. and if they leave, no one will remain. The English sentence also implies
#. that the speaker wants to add another administrator before leaving, so the
#. Portuguese version maintains this nuance.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:311 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:375
msgid ""
"You are the only admin in this private room. If you leave the room, no one "
"will be left. Please add another admin from the members before you remove "
"yourself."
msgstr ""
"Você é o único administrador desse salão privado. Se você sair do salão, "
"ninguém ficará. Por favor, adicione outro administrador dos membros antes de"
" se retirar."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person has left a specific location (the
#. room/salon). The English phrase "You have left the room" can be ambiguous,
#. but in this context, it is clear that the speaker is referring to leaving a
#. physical space.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:320 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:383
msgid "You have left the room"
msgstr "Você saiu da sala."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is not a member of the private
#. room. The English sentence and its context translation make it clear that
#. "this private room" refers to a specific, exclusive space, so the
#. Portuguese version "este salão privado" follows this interpretation.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:346 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:205
#: chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:242 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:368

msgid "You are not a member of this private room"
msgstr "Você não é um membro deste salão privado."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is not an administrator of a
#. private room. The English sentence can be ambiguous, as it could refer to
#. any type of private space or organization. However, in this context, where
#. "admin" likely refers to administrative access or control, the French and
#. Portuguese translations make it clear that the person does not have such
#. authority over the private room.
#: chat/tests/tests_private.py:370 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:278
#: chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:321 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:443

msgid "You are not an admin of this private room"
msgstr "Você não é administrador desse quarto privado."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Follow" can have multiple meanings,
#. including to track or pursue someone or something. In this context, the
#. French translation "Suivre" is more literal and implies tracking or
#. following someone or something. The Portuguese translation "Seguir"
#. captures this meaning, suggesting a sense of movement or progression in
#. relation to what is being followed.
#: chat/tests/tests_public.py:23 chat/tests/tests_public.py:66
msgid "Follow"
msgstr "Seguir"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a singular noun. The English phrase "%(nfollowers)s
#. follower" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "followers" and "followed
#. by". However, in this context, it seems to refer to a single person who
#. follows someone else, so the Portuguese translation uses the singular form
#. "seguidor".
#: chat/tests/tests_public.py:65

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that another room with a similar name already
#. exists and asks to choose a different one. The English sentence is slightly
#. rephrased for better clarity, but the overall message remains the same.
#: chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:157 chat/views/views_public_rooms.py:80

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a specific method is not allowed. The English
#. phrase "Method not allowed" is commonly used in HTTP responses to indicate
#. that a particular request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is not
#. supported or permitted for a given resource.
#: chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:273 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:439
msgid "Method not allowed"
msgstr "Método não permitido"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is already a member of the private
#. room. The English sentence implies that the user has been invited or added
#. to the room, whereas the French translation makes it clear that the user is
#. an existing member.
#: chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:288 chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:455
msgid "This user is already a member of this private room"
msgstr "Este usuário já é um membro deste quarto privado"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is not a member of the private
#. room. The English sentence uses "user" and "room", while the French
#. translation uses "utilisateur" (meaning user) and "salon" (meaning room),
#. but with the adjective "privé" to indicate it's a private space.
#: chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:335
msgid "This user is not a member of this private room"
msgstr "Este usuário não é membro deste quarto privado"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which emphasizes the necessity of having at least one administrator
#. in a private room and provides instructions on how to add another one
#. before removing an existing one.
#: chat/views/views_private_rooms.py:497
msgid ""
"There must be at least one admin in a private room. Please add another one "
"before removing this one."
msgstr ""
"Existem pelo menos um administrador em uma sala privada. Por favor, adicione"
" outro antes de remover esse outro."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is not an administrator of a
#. private room. The English sentence "This member is not an admin of this
#. private room" can be ambiguous, as it could refer to any type of membership
#. or access level. The French translation makes it clear that it is a
#. specific role (administrateur) and context (salon privé), so the Portuguese
#. version follows this interpretation.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person was removed from the administrative
#. role in a private room. The English sentence "You have been removed from
#. the admins of this private room" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both
#. being removed from an admin group and being removed from a private space.
#. The French translation makes it clear that it is a removal from the
#. administrative role in a private space, so the Portuguese version follows
#. this interpretation.

msgstr "Você foi removido dos administradores deste quarto privado."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that another private room with a similar name
#. already exists. The English sentence is slightly ambiguous due to the use
#. of "almost the same name", but the French translation makes it clear that
#. it's about an existing room with a very similar name.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that only the owner has the right to modify the
#. room. The English sentence is somewhat ambiguous, but the French
#. translation makes it clear that it's about the owner having exclusive
#. editing rights.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that only the owner has the right to delete the
#. room. The English sentence is ambiguous, as it could be interpreted in a
#. more general sense, but the French translation makes it clear that it's
#. specific to the owner, so the Portuguese version follows this
#. interpretation.
