    Search for private members in a given chat room.

    This view is accessible only to authenticated users. It performs an AJAX search

    last name's last word, and first name's first word of the `Member` model.
    The results are limited to the first 12 matching members.

    Parameters:
    - `request` (HttpRequest): The HTTP request object.
    - `room_slug` (str): The slug of the chat room to search in.

    Returns:
    - `JsonResponse`: A JSON response containing the search results. The response
      is a dictionary with a single key `'results'` which contains a list of dictionaries
      representing the matching members. Each dictionary contains the `id` and `text`
      fields of the matching member.
