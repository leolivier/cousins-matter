#. Explanation: The provided sentence is a template for describing a new

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, using placeholders to maintain the original sentence
#. structure.  The use of "hat" and "Erstellt" is consistent with the context
#. and maintains the grammatical structure of the original sentence.

"%(followed_object_name)s"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, while preserving the original sentence structure and
#. placeholders.  The use of "ein" for "a new" and "wurde" for "was added"
#. maintains consistency with the original text's tone and style.

#. **Explanation:**  The provided text is a placeholder-based translation. The
#. placeholders are crucial to understanding the sentence's meaning.
#. * **Placeholders:**
#.     * `%(follower_name)s`: Represents the name of the person adding the new
#. object.
#.     * `%(obj_type)s`: Represents the type of object being added.
#.     * `%(followed_type)s`: Represents the category or context where the
#. object is being added (e.g., "profile", "project").
#.     * `%(followed_object_name)s`: Represents the name of the specific
#. object being added.
#. * **Translation:** The German translation accurately reflects the meaning
#. of the French phrase by using the placeholders to represent the actual
#. objects and categories in the sentence.  The use of "hat" for "a ajouté"
#. and "hinzugefügt" for "added" is a common way to translate this type of
#. sentence.

#. Explanation: The German translation aims to capture the meaning of the
#. French phrase while maintaining a consistent grammatical structure.  The
#. use of "Du bist nicht mehr" conveys that the subject is no longer following
#. something, and "Folge dieser {followed_type}" clarifies the specific type
#. of content being referred to.

#. of the French translation.  The use of "Neuer Follower" (new follower),
#. "für dein %(followed_type)s" (for your %(followed_type)s), and

#. their corresponding German equivalents, while also maintaining a consistent

#. Explanation: The translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English
#. and French sentences.  "Ton message" is a direct translation of "Your
#. message" in French, while "Dein Nachricht" uses German word order to
#. reflect the same meaning.
#: cm_main/forms.py:8
msgid "Your message"
msgstr "Dein Nachricht"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Merci d'être bref et d'éviter les

#. German as "Website-Statistiken". This accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the original text. The use of "Website" in German is a direct translation
#. of "site," and "Statistiken" means statistics.

#. Explanation: "Home" in English is a general term for a place of residence.
#. "Accueil" in French translates to "home" as well, but it can also be used
#. more broadly to mean "welcome" or "entrance." The context provided by the
#. French translation helps us understand that the word "Home" refers to a
#. place of residence.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:8
msgid "Home"
msgstr "Heim"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the website was built with pride.  The
#. English phrase "proudly built" can be ambiguous in terms of the specific
#. method used to build the site, so the German version "Diese Website stolz
#. gebaut mit" follows this interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:68
msgid "This site proudly built using"
msgstr "Diese Website stolz gebaut mit"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the code is under a license.  The
#. English phrase "The source code is licensed" can be ambiguous as it can
#. mean both "giving a ring" and "making a phone call" colloquially. The
#. French translation makes it clear that it is a phone call, so the German
#. version "Die Quellcode ist lizenziert" follows this interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:70
msgid "The source code is licensed"
msgstr "Die Quellcode ist lizenziert"

#. Explanation: The provided English and French translations accurately
#. reflect the meaning of the original text.  The German translation uses the
#. standard copyright symbol (©) and includes the specific year, as well as
#. the phrase "Alle Rechte vorbehalten," which translates to "All rights
#. reserved" in English.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:76
msgid "Copyright © 2024 Cousins Matter. All rights reserved."
msgstr "Urheberrecht © 2024 Cousins Matter. Alle Rechte vorbehalten."

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the user should contact the

msgid "Contact the site admin"
msgstr "Kontaktiere den Site-Administrator"

#. Explanation:  Both "Confirm" and "Confirmer" are generally used to indicate
#. agreement or acceptance. The German word "Bestätigen" translates to
#. "confirm" in a similar way to the English phrase, as it implies an act of
#. verifying or endorsing something.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:28
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:54
msgid "Confirm"
msgstr "Bestätigen"

#. Explanation:  "Cancel" and "Annuler" both mean to cancel or terminate
#. something. The German word "Abbrechen" is a more direct translation of the
#. English phrase, conveying the same meaning as "Cancel".

#. Explanation: The translation aims to maintain the original meaning and tone
#. of the French text. It uses a more direct and clear language, while also
#. preserving the context provided by the placeholders.  The use of "Bitte
#. geben Sie" ("Please enter") is a common way to request an action in German.

#. Explanation: The French translation clarifies that the deletion will only
#. occur after a correct value is entered.  The German translation aims to
#. maintain the same meaning and tone as the French version while using
#. appropriate German grammar and vocabulary.

msgstr ""
"Pflicht. Die Löschung findet erst statt, wenn die korrekte Wert eingegeben "

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Toggle Note Editor Toolbar" is a command
#. to show or hide the toolbar.  The French translation, "Afficher/Masquer la
#. barre d'outils," translates this into German as "Schalten Sie die
#. Notizbearbeitungs-Werkzeugleiste ein."
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/include-summernote.html:6
msgid "Toggle Note Editor Toolbar"
msgstr "Schalten Sie die Notizbearbeitungs-Werkzeugleiste ein"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Remaining characters:" is translated into

msgid "Remaining characters:"
msgstr "Verbleibende Zeichen:"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Items par page," is a direct and
#. accurate representation of the English phrase "Items per page."  It uses
#. the word "par" to indicate "per" in French. This translation maintains the
#. meaning and clarity of the original sentence.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:20
msgid "Items per page:"
msgstr "Items pro Seite:"

#. Explanation:  The English phrase "go to first page" is translated directly
#. into German as "Gehe zur ersten Seite". The French translation "aller à la
#. 1ère page" is a more literal translation, while the German translation uses
#. the verb "gehen" which means "to go", and "zur ersten Seite" specifies the
#. direction.  This maintains the meaning of the original sentence in a clear
#. and concise way.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:40
msgid "go to first page"
msgstr "Gehe zur ersten Seite"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. English and French sentences.  The use of "Gehe" (go to) and "zur Seite"
#. (to the page) is consistent with the context, while "Seite #%(page_num)s"
#. maintains the placeholder format for accurate translation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:52
#, python-format
msgid "go to page #%(page_num)s"
msgstr "Gehe zur Seite #%(page_num)s"

#, python-format
msgid "page #%(page_num)s"
msgstr "Seite #%(page_num)s"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "go to last page" is translated into German
#. as "Gehe zur letzten Seite". This translates the meaning of going to the
#. last page in a document.  The French translation "Aller à la dernière page"
#. also conveys this meaning, but it's important to note that the German
#. translation maintains the same grammatical structure and word order for
#. clarity and consistency.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:68
msgid "go to last page"
msgstr "Gehe zur letzten Seite"

#. Explanation: The English term "Contact Form" is translated directly to
#. "Formulaire de contact" in French.  The German word "Kontaktformular"
#. accurately reflects the meaning of the English phrase, as it refers to a
#. form used for contacting someone or something.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:6
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:9
msgid "Contact Form"
msgstr "Kontaktformular"

#. Explanation: The French translation is already quite clear and concise. I
#. have translated the sentence to German while keeping the same structure and
#. meaning as the French version.  The use of "Bitte ausfüllen Sie" means
#. "Please fill out," and "mit dem Administrator dieser Website in Kontakt zu
#. treten" means "to contact the administrator of this website."
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:10

msgid "Send"
msgstr "Senden"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the sender sent a message from the
#. specified website.  The use of placeholders like "%(sender_name)s" and
#. "%(site_name)s" is crucial for maintaining the original sentence's
#. structure and conveying the intended meaning in German.

#. Explanation: The provided English and French translations are both

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Stop Following" is translated into German
#. as "Stopp Folgen". This accurately reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which means to stop following someone.  The word "Folgen" in German
#. directly translates to "following" and is used to convey the same idea as
#. "Arréter de suivre" in French.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/toggle-follow-button.html:4
msgid "Stop Following"

#. Explanation:  Both "follow" and "suivre" mean to pursue or keep up with

msgid "Create Member"
msgstr "Erstellen Sie Mitglied"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Invite Member" can be interpreted in two
#. ways. It could mean inviting someone to join a group or organization, or it
#. could refer to sending an invitation for a specific event.  The French
#. translation "Inviter un Membre" is more ambiguous and requires context to
#. determine the exact meaning.
#. For example, if the sentence refers to inviting someone to join a club,
#. then "Einladung zum Mitglied werden" would be appropriate. If the sentence
#. refers to an event, then "Inviter un Membre" might be better suited.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:38
msgid "Invite Member"
msgstr "Einladung zum Mitglied werden"

#. Explanation: The English word "Galleries" is a plural noun referring to
