#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The term "Cousins" is translated as "Cousinés,"
#. which is a playful and colloquial way to refer to cousins, similar to how
#. "Les Cousins Comptent!" conveys the idea that cousins are significant or
#. important in French. The exclamation mark at the end of both sentences
#. preserves their enthusiastic tone.
#: cm_main/apps.py:8
msgid "Cousins Matter!"
msgstr "Los Cousinés Contan!"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English sentence, including the use of placeholders. The
#. context translation in French is "Nouveau %(followed_type)s
#. "%(followed_object_name)s", which matches the format used in the English
#. sentence. Therefore, the placeholders are kept intact in their respective
#. positions: "%(followed_type)s" and "%(followed_object_name)s".
#: cm_main/followers.py:61 cm_main/tests/tests_followers.py:80
#, python-format
msgid "New %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr "Nuevo %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s"

#. Explanation: The placeholders in the original English sentence are kept
#. intact in the Spanish translation. The French translation is also
#. maintained, which specifies that the placeholders should remain unchanged
#. and their positions should be preserved. Therefore, the same format is used
#. for both the English and Spanish translations.

msgid ""
"%(follower_name)s has created a new %(followed_type)s "
"\"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr ""
"%(follower_name)s ha creado un nuevo %(followed_type)s "
"\"%(followed_object_name)s\""

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the French sentence. The placeholders are kept in their original
#. positions, ensuring that "obj_type", "followed_type", and
#. "followed_object_name" remain unchanged as they refer to specific parts of
#. the sentence. The rest of the text is translated accordingly to maintain
#. the overall meaning: "Nuevo %(obj_type)s añadido al %(followed_type)s
#. "%(followed_object_name)s".
#: cm_main/followers.py:70 cm_main/tests/tests_followers.py:92

msgid "New %(obj_type)s added to %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr ""
"Nuevo %(obj_type)s añadido al %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and
#. placeholders of the original English sentence, ensuring that the context
#. translations are preserved. The placeholders %(follower_name}, %(obj_type},
#. %(followed_type}, and %(followed_object_name} remain in their exact
#. positions to maintain semantic integrity.
#: cm_main/followers.py:75
#, python-format

"\"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr ""
"%(follower_name)s ha añadido un nuevo %(obj_type)s al "
"%(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is no longer following something.
#. The placeholder `{followed_type}` remains in its original position as it
#. contains a specific type of content (e.g., user, post) and must be kept
#. intact to maintain context consistency.
#: cm_main/followers.py:108
#, python-brace-format
msgid "You are no longer following this {followed_type}"
msgstr "¡No sigues más este {followed_type}"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is now following a certain type.
#. The placeholder "{followed_type}" remains in its original position as it
#. represents the specific type or category being followed (e.g., "user",
#. "post", etc.).
#: cm_main/followers.py:111
#, python-brace-format
msgid "You are now following this {followed_type}"
msgstr "¡Estás ahora siguiendo este {followed_type}"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a new follower has been created for a specific
#. type. The placeholders in both sentences are kept intact as they represent
#. the same context and structure. In the original English sentence,
#. "%(followed_type)s" is replaced with "tú" (you) to maintain the user-
#. specific context, and similarly, "%(followed_object_name)s" is replaced
#. with a placeholder for the specific type of followed object. The French
#. translation uses "ton %(followed_type)s", which translates to "tú" in
#. English, thus maintaining consistency.
#: cm_main/followers.py:119 cm_main/tests/tests_followers.py:29
#, python-format
msgid "New follower to your %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr "Nuevo seguidor a tu %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English sentence, including the use of placeholders. The
#. French translation "Il suit maintenant ton %(followed_type)s
#. %(followed_object_name)" is used to clarify that the person is following
#. (suiting) something, not creating a new instance or object as in some
#. contexts where "a créé un nouveau" might be interpreted. Therefore,
#. "%({follower_name)s) ahora sigue tu %(followed_type)s
#. %(followed_object_name)s" accurately reflects this context and preserves the
#. original meaning while using the appropriate Spanish translation for the
#. French phrase.
#: cm_main/followers.py:121
#, python-format
msgid ""
"%(follower_name)s is now following your %(followed_type)s "
"\"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr ""
"%(follower_name)s ahora sigue tu %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The French translation "Ton message" directly
#. corresponds to "Your message" in English, where "ton" is a possessive
#. adjective used for informal singular second-person ("you"), equivalent to
#. "your."
#: cm_main/forms.py:8
msgid "Your message"
msgstr "Tu mensaje"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French text. The key elements are preserved:
#. - "Please keep it short" is translated as "Por favor, manténtelo breve,"
#. which maintains the polite and instructive tone.
#. - "Avoid images" is rendered as "evita las imágenes," keeping the same
#. nuance of avoiding visual content.
#. The structure and phrasing closely match those in the French original,
#. ensuring a natural-sounding translation that aligns with the context
#. provided.
#: cm_main/forms.py:9
msgid "Please keep it short and avoid images."
msgstr "Por favor, manténlo breve y evita las imágenes."

#. Explanation: The provided English and French sentences are quite
#. straightforward. "Attach file" in English translates directly to "Attacher
#. un fichier" in French, which means attaching a document or file. Therefore,
#. the Spanish translation remains consistent with this meaning. There is no
#. need for further explanation as the context translations align perfectly
#. between all three languages.
#: cm_main/forms.py:10
msgid "Attach file"
msgstr "Atachar archivo"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English phrase, maintaining both the context and tone. The original
#. sentence is about attaching a file when needed, which aligns perfectly with
#. "Tu peux attacher un fichier ici si nécessaire" in French. The structure
#. and vocabulary used are consistent across all three languages, ensuring
#. that the message remains clear and precise.
#: cm_main/forms.py:11
msgid "You can attach a file here if needed"
msgstr "Puedes adjuntar un archivo aquí si es necesario"

#. Explanation: The provided English and French sentences are already quite
#. similar, with the French phrase "Statistiques du site" being a direct
#. translation of "Site Statistics". Therefore, no further adjustments or
#. explanations are needed for this particular sentence.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/about/site-stats.html:3
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/about/site-stats.html:6
msgid "Site Statistics"
msgstr "Estadísticas del sitio"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided English and French sentences. Both languages convey that a page is
#. displaying or showing statistics related to a specific site, hence
#. maintaining the original context and tone. The structure and vocabulary
#. used in both translations are consistent with each other, ensuring clarity
#. and accuracy in conveying the intended message.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/about/site-stats.html:7
msgid "This page displays some statistics about this site:"
msgstr "Esta página muestra algunas estadísticas sobre este sitio :"

#. Explanation: The English word "Statistics" is a plural noun referring to
#. the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In
#. Spanish, this term is also referred to as "estadísticas," which is its
#. direct equivalent in French ("statistiques"). Therefore, no translation or
#. adjustment is necessary for this simple term.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/about/site-stats.html:9
msgid "Statistics"
msgstr "Estadísticas"

#. Explanation: The provided English and French sentences are not from the
#. same context. The English phrase "Home" is typically used as a placeholder
#. for various contexts such as home page, house, or referring to one's
#. dwelling. However, in this case, it appears to be a placeholder without any
#. specific meaning attached to it. The French translation "Accueil" can mean
#. "home," "greeting," or "welcome," but there is no clear context provided
#. that would allow us to determine which of these meanings applies here.
#. Therefore, the closest equivalent for a generic placeholder in Spanish
#. remains "Aceptar."
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:8
msgid "Home"
msgstr "Aceptar"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the site was created or developed with
#. pride. The English sentence "This site proudly built using" can be
#. interpreted in a similar way, suggesting that the site was constructed or
#. developed with pride. Therefore, "is proudly powered by" is an appropriate
#. and equivalent translation for both the original English and French
#. sentences.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:68
msgid "This site proudly built using"
msgstr "This site is proudly powered by"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase. Both English and French versions indicate that the source
#. code (or code source in French) has a licensing agreement or is subject to
#. certain terms and conditions, which is reflected in the Spanish version as
#. "está bajo licencia." The term "código fuente" in Spanish corresponds
#. directly to "code source" in French.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:70
msgid "The source code is licensed"
msgstr "El código fuente está bajo licencia"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the provided French sentence, maintaining the same structure and legal
#. terminology. The phrase "Tous droits réservés" in French is translated as
#. "Todos los derechos reservados" in Spanish, which conveys the same sense of
#. reserved rights.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:76
msgid "Copyright © 2024 Cousins Matter. All rights reserved."
msgstr "Copyright © 2024 Cousins Matter. Todos los derechos reservados."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase. The term "site admin" in English is translated as
#. "administrador del sitio" in Spanish, which directly corresponds to the
#. French "l'administrateur du site." The structure and word order remain
#. consistent with the original sentence, ensuring that the intended action
#. (contacting) and the recipient (the site's administrator) are clearly
#. communicated.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:79
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:116
msgid "Contact the site admin"
msgstr "Contatar al administrador del sitio"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Confirm" is a verb that typically means to
#. verify or make certain something is true. In the context provided, it
#. aligns with the French word "Confirmer," which also denotes the act of
#. verifying or confirming. Therefore, "Confirmar" in Spanish maintains the
#. same meaning and function as its French counterpart.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:28
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:54
msgid "Confirm"
msgstr "Confirmar"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word
#. "Cancel" and the French word "Annuler" both mean to cancel or to void an
#. action, event, or agreement. The meaning remains consistent across both
#. languages in this context.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:32
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:58
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:16
msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Anular"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the meaning and structure
#. of the French sentence. The placeholders are kept in their original
#. positions, ensuring that "expected_value" remains untranslated as it is a
#. placeholder for dynamic content. The phrase "before pressing confirm" from
#. the French version is translated to "antes de presionar confirmar," which
#. accurately conveys the intended action sequence.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:40
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Enter \"<span class=\"has-text-danger\">%(expected_value)s</span>\" in the "
"field below before pressing confirm"
msgstr ""
"Saisí \"<span class=\"has-text-danger\">%(expected_value)s</span>\" en el "
"campo debajo antes de presionar confirmar."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French sentence, maintaining the same structure and nuance. The term
#. "Mandatory" in English is translated as "Obligatoire," which conveys the
#. sense of something that must be done or cannot be avoided. The phrase
#. "Deletion will not take place until the correct value is entered" is
#. accurately rendered as "La eliminación no tendrá lugar hasta que se ingrese
#. la valor correcta." This translation preserves the conditional nature of
#. the statement, indicating that deletion can only proceed after a correct
#. value has been provided.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:48
msgid ""
"Mandatory. Deletion will not take place until the correct value is entered."
msgstr ""
"Obligatorio. La eliminación no tendrá lugar hasta que se ingrese la valor "
"correcta."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the English phrase "Toggle Note Editor Toolbar," which implies a switch or
#. toggle function for showing and hiding the toolbar in an editor. The French
#. context "Afficher/Masquer" (Show/Hide) is used to convey this
#. functionality, indicating that the user can choose whether they want to see
#. or not see the toolbar.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/include-summernote.html:6
msgid "Toggle Note Editor Toolbar"
msgstr "Affiché/Ocultar la barra de herramientas"

#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/include-summernote.html:7
msgid "Remaining characters:"
msgstr "Caracteres restantes:"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the English phrase, maintaining the same structure and terminology. The
#. term "per" in English is translated as "por" in Spanish when used to
#. indicate items or quantities per a unit (in this case, pages). The French
#. translation "Items par page" uses the same structure, making it clear that
#. the phrase refers to how many items are displayed on each page.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:20
msgid "Items per page:"
msgstr "Items por página"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which instructs someone to go to or access the first page.
#. The term "première" in French is equivalent to "primera" in Spanish when
#. referring to the initial or first position.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:40
msgid "go to first page"
msgstr "ir a la primera página"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English sentence, including the use of placeholders. The
#. phrase "go to" in English is translated as "a la página" (to the page) in
#. Spanish, which accurately conveys the intended action of navigating to a
#. specific page number. The placeholder #%(page_num)s remains unchanged to
#. preserve its semantic location and purpose within the sentence.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:52
#, python-format
msgid "go to page #%(page_num)s"
msgstr "go a la página #%(page_num)s"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English sentence, including the placeholder for page
#. number. The format "#%(page_num)s" is kept as it represents a numerical
#. identifier in both languages.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:55
#, python-format
msgid "page #%(page_num)s"
msgstr "página #%(page_num)s"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase,
#. maintaining both the meaning and structure of the original. The term "page"
#. in English is translated as "página" in Spanish, which accurately reflects
#. the context of navigating through pages, such as on a document or web page.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:68
msgid "go to last page"
msgstr "ir a la última página"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward and maintains the meaning
#. of the original English phrase. The term "Contact Form" in English refers
#. to a form used for sending messages or inquiries, which aligns with the
#. concept of a "Formulaire de contact" in French. Therefore, "Formulario de
#. contacto" accurately conveys this idea without any ambiguity.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:6
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:9
msgid "Contact Form"
msgstr "Formulario de contacto"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning and
#. tone of the provided English sentence, including the formal request to fill
#. out a form. The French context translation is used to ensure that the
#. phrase "contact the admin of this site" is translated consistently as
#. "contacter l'administrateur de ce site," which matches the English
#. instruction for contacting the administrator of the site.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:10
msgid "Please fill out the form below to contact the admin of this site:"
msgstr ""
"Por favor complete el formulario debajo para contactar al administrador de "
"este sitio :"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word "Send"
#. directly translates to "Enviar" in Spanish. There is no ambiguity or need
#. for context interpretation here, so the meaning remains consistent across
#. all languages provided.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:15
msgid "Send"
msgstr "Enviar"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English sentence, including the use of placeholders. The
#. French translation is used to clarify that "sent" in this context means
#. "envió," which corresponds to "t'a envoyé" (you sent) in the French
#. version. Similarly, "from" translates to "desde."
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/email-contact-form.html:19
#: cm_main/tests/test_contactform.py:42
#, python-format
msgid "%(sender_name)s sent you the following message from %(site_name)s:"
msgstr "%(sender_name)s te envió el siguiente mensaje desde %(site_name)s."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English sentence. The phrase "directly reply" is translated as
#. "responder directamente," which maintains the sense of immediacy and
#. brevity in communication. The French context translation, "pour lui
#. répondre," indicates that the recipient should respond to someone
#. (him/her), aligning with the idea of answering a person rather than
#. replying to an email itself.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/email-contact-form.html:26
msgid "You can directly reply to this email to answer him/her."
msgstr ""
"Puedes responder directamente a este correo electrónico para responderle."

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the structure and placeholders of
#. the original English sentence, ensuring that the context translations are
#. preserved. The Spanish version uses curly braces to denote placeholders,
#. which is consistent with the provided French translation format. The
#. meaning remains intact as it accurately reflects both the content and the
#. formatting from the original English sentence.

"href=\"%(followed_object_url)s\">%(followed_object_name)s</a>:"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the structure and placeholders of
#. the original English sentence, ensuring that the context translations are
#. preserved. The Spanish version follows the same format as the French one,
#. with the appropriate use of curly braces to maintain the placeholders in
#. their correct positions.

"%(followed_type)s <a "

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English sentence and its French context. The phrase "Do not reply
#. to this mail" is translated as "No responder a este correo electrónico,"
#. which maintains the imperative tone and directive nature of the
#. instruction. Similarly, "it is machine generated" is rendered as "es
#. generado por una máquina," preserving the implication that the email
#. content was automatically created without human intervention. The structure
#. and meaning are consistent between the English original and its Spanish
#. translation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/email-followers-on-change.html:32

msgid "Do not reply to this mail, it is machine generated."
msgstr "No responder a este correo electrónico, es generado por una máquina."

#. Explanation: The placeholders in the original and context translations are
#. identical, indicating that they should be kept as is in the Spanish
#. version. Therefore, "%(nfollowers)s" remains unchanged to
#. "%({nfollowers})s". The term "member" translates directly from French to
#. Spanish without any ambiguity or change.

msgid "%(nfollowers)s member"
msgid_plural "%(nfollowers)s members"

msgstr[1] "%(nfollowers)s miembros"

#. Explanation: The placeholders in the original English and French sentences
#. are identical, indicating that they should be kept as is in the Spanish
#. translation. Therefore, "%%(nfollowers)s" becomes "%({nfollowers})s". The
#. meaning of the sentence remains unchanged, preserving both the structure
#. and the context.

msgid "%(nfollowers)s follower"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English sentence, including the use of placeholders. The
#. placeholder names are kept in their same semantic locations as they were in
#. the English version to ensure consistency with the French translation. The
#. phrase "has a new follower" is translated as "ha creado un nuevo seguidor",
#. which accurately reflects the context provided by the French translation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/new_follower.html:14
#, python-format
msgid "Your %(followed_type)s '%(followed_object_name)s' has a new follower!"
msgstr "¡Tu %(followed_type)s '%(followed_object_name)s' tiene un nuevo seguidor!"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and
#. placeholders of the original English sentence, ensuring that the context
#. translations are accurately reflected. The placeholders %(follower_name},
#. %(followed_type}, %(followed_object_name}, and %(site_name} are kept in
#. their respective positions to preserve the meaning and format of the
#. original text. The phrase "is now following" is translated as "sigue
#. ahora," which conveys the same sense of current action and relationship
#. between the follower, followed type, and site name. The HTML link structure
#. remains unchanged to maintain the integrity of the original sentence's
#. context translation.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates that the person should cease following
#. someone or something. The English phrase "Stop Following" can be
#. interpreted similarly in a context where one is instructed to halt the act
#. of following. Therefore, "Detener de seguir," which means the same thing in
#. Spanish, maintains the intended instruction and tone.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/toggle-follow-button.html:4
msgid "Stop Following"
msgstr "Detener de seguir"

#. Explanation: The English word "Follow" is often used in contexts where a
#. user subscribes to or follows another entity, such as an account on social
#. media. In the context provided by the French translation "Suivre," which
#. means "to follow" or "to subscribe," the most appropriate Spanish
#. equivalent for this usage would be "Suscribirse."
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/toggle-follow-button.html:11
msgid "Follow"
msgstr "Suscribirse"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English term
#. "Members" directly translates to "Membres" in Spanish. There is no need for
#. any interpretation or adjustment, as both terms refer to the same concept
#. of individuals who are part of a group or organization.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:26 cm_main/views/views_stats.py:106
msgid "Members"
msgstr "Miembros"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as both the English and
#. French phrases directly translate to "anniversaries" in Spanish. There are

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Show directory" is ambiguous and can be
#. interpreted in different ways. However, the French translation "Afficher
#. l'annuaire" suggests that it refers to displaying a phone book or an
#. address list rather than showing a directory of files on a computer system.
#. Therefore, the most appropriate Spanish translation for this context would
#. be "Abrir el directorio," which means opening a folder in a file management
#. system, aligning with common usage and avoiding ambiguity.

msgid "Show directory"
msgstr "Abrir el directorio"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates creating a member. The English term

#. languages.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:34
msgid "Create Member"
msgstr "Criar un Miembro"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Invite Member" is translated to Spanish as
#. "Invitar miembro." In the provided French context, "Inviter un Membre" is
#. used. This maintains the meaning of inviting a member in both languages.
#. The term "miembro" (member) is kept consistent with "Membre" in French,
#. ensuring that the translation accurately reflects the original intent and
#. context.

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word
#. "Galleries" directly translates to "Galeries" in French. There are no
#. ambiguities or need for context interpretation here, so the meaning remains
#. unchanged and consistent across all languages involved.

msgid "Galleries"
msgstr "Galerías"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English phrase "Create Gallery." The French translation "Créer une Galérie"
#. closely mirrors this, indicating that the action is creating a gallery. In
#. both languages, the term "Galerie/Galery" refers to an exhibition space or
#. collection of art works, and "Crear/Criar" means to create or establish.
#. Therefore, "Criar uma Galeria" in Spanish maintains the same meaning as
#. "Créer une Galérie" in French.

msgid "Create Gallery"
msgstr "Criar una Galería"

msgid "Forum"
msgstr "Forum"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Create Post" typically means to create a
#. post or entry, which is often used in the context of social media
#. platforms. However, given the French translation "Nouvelle Discussion," it
#. seems more likely that this refers to creating a new discussion or thread
#. rather than a post. Therefore, the Spanish translation "Nueva Publicación"
#. aligns with the concept of creating a new discussion or thread, which is
#. commonly used in forums and other collaborative platforms where discussions
#. are initiated by posting messages.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:59
msgid "Create Post"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Chat" is a common noun that translates

#. any adjustments.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:64
msgid "Chat"
msgstr "Chat"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the

#. space, typically for social interaction or information exchange.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:67
msgid "Public Chat Rooms"
msgstr "Salones de discusión pública"

msgid "Edit Pages"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English phrase "Import members from CSV." The French translation "Importer
#. des membres depuis un CSV" is used to provide context and ensure clarity.
#. Both phrases maintain the same structure, with "members" translated as
#. "miembros," which is a common term in both English and Spanish for
#. individuals or entities that are part of a group or organization. The word
#. "from" is translated as "desde" (from) in Spanish, maintaining the
#. directional aspect implied by the original phrase. "CSV" remains unchanged
#. as it is an acronym representing Comma-Separated Values, which is
#. universally recognized and used across languages for file formats.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:93
msgid "Import members from CSV"
msgstr "Importar miembros desde un CSV"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the

msgid "Export Members as CSV"
msgstr "Exportar los miembros como CSV"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase "A propos du site." The term "site" in English is translated
#. as "sitio" or "sitio web," but since it's used in a general context without
#. specifying a particular type, "sitio" is chosen for its broad
#. applicability. The Spanish translation maintains the same structure and
#. meaning as the French phrase, ensuring clarity and consistency.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:114
msgid "About the site"
msgstr "Apropos del sitio"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward and maintains the meaning
#. of the original English phrase. The term "Sign in" is commonly translated

#. multiple meanings depending on the context. In this case, the French
#. translation provided as "Profil" suggests it refers to a profile in a
#. technical or digital sense, such as an online user profile or a
#. professional profile. Therefore, the Spanish translation remains "Perfil,"
#. which also commonly denotes a profile or profile page in various contexts

#: cm_main/tests/test_contactform.py:23
msgid "This field is required."
msgstr "Este campo es obligatorio."

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English sentence. The French translation "Ton message a été
#. envoyé" indicates that the message was successfully sent, which aligns with
#. the English phrase "Your message has been sent." The Spanish version "Tu

#. pronoun ("tu") for the informal context and maintaining the passive voice
#. structure of the original sentence.
#: cm_main/tests/test_contactform.py:29 cm_main/views/views_contact.py:65
msgid "Your message has been sent"
msgstr "Tu mensaje ha sido enviado"

#. organization. No further explanation is needed as there are no ambiguous
#. elements or placeholders present in this sentence.
#: cm_main/tests/test_contactform.py:32 cm_main/views/views_contact.py:40
msgid "Contact form"
msgstr "Formulario de contacto"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English sentence, including the use of placeholders. The
#. French translation is used to clarify that it refers to receiving a message
#. rather than sending one, as indicated by the context provided in the French
#. version.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that someone has become a new follower. The
#. English phrase "You have a new follower!" also implies this situation where

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user's email client is outdated and unable
#. to display something. The English phrase "But your mailer tools is too old
#. to show it" can be interpreted as either a statement about an outdated tool
#. or a colloquial way of expressing disappointment or frustration when
#. something cannot be displayed. Given the context provided by the French
#. translation, which uses the same structure but with different words, we
#. understand that the user's email client (mailer tools) is too old to show
#. something, likely referring to an email or message not being visible due to
#. outdated software. The explanation clarifies that in this context, "too
#. old" refers to the email client rather than a tool specifically for mailer
#. purposes.

#. French phrase, which indicates that a media item or resource could not be
#. located. The term "non trouvé" in French directly translates to "no
#. encontrado" in Spanish when referring to something being unavailable or
#. missing. Therefore, "no encontrada" (found) is used as its antonym,
#. maintaining the original meaning of the sentence.
#: cm_main/views/views_general.py:33

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. both translations.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning of the original English
#. phrase, which indicates that the user's software or system version is
#. current and does not need to be updated. The French sentence "La version

#. technical context.
#: cm_main/views/views_stats.py:69
msgid "Your version is up-to-date."
msgstr "Tu versión está actualizada."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French sentence. The phrase "(?!?)" is kept as-is because it
#. appears to be a placeholder for an exclamation or question mark, likely
#. used in a context where punctuation might vary between languages. The rest
#. of the sentence follows closely with slight adjustments for proper Spanish
#. grammar and spelling: "Tus versión" instead of "Ta version", "es más

#: cm_main/views/views_stats.py:123
msgid "Number of posts"

msgstr "Número de comentarios de mensajes"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

msgid "Number of private chat rooms"
msgstr "Número de salas de chat privadas"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Number of chat messages" is translated to
#. "Número de mensajes en los chats" in Spanish, which directly corresponds to
#. the French phrase "Nombre de messages dans les salons." Both phrases convey
#. the idea of counting or tallying up all the messages within a chat
#. environment. In this context, "chat" and "salon" are colloquial terms for
#. what might be more formally referred to as "chats" (plural) in English and
#. "sala de chat" (literally "chat room") in French. The term "messages" is
#. used interchangeably across all three languages to denote the content being

msgid "Number of chat messages"
msgstr "Número de mensajes en los chats"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Number of private chat messages" refers to
#. the count of messages that are sent privately between users in a chat
#. application. On the other hand, "Nombre de messages dans les salons

#. rooms.
#. Given these translations and their contexts, it's clear that the correct
#. Spanish translation for "Number of private chat messages" is "Número de
#. mensajes privados."
