#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which emphasizes the importance of cousins. The exclamation mark at
#. the end is preserved to maintain the same tone and emphasis as in the
#. original English sentence.
#: cm_main/apps.py:8
msgid "Cousins Matter!"
msgstr "Os Primos Importam!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a new object of a certain type has been
#. created. The English phrase "New %(followed_type)s
#. "%(followed_object_name)s"" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "a new
#. object of this type" and "an object of this type that is new". The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is a new object, so the Portuguese
#. version "Novo %(followed_type)s "%(followed_object_name)s"" follows this
#. interpretation.
#: cm_main/followers.py:61 cm_main/tests/tests_followers.py:80
#, python-format
msgid "New %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr "Novo %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person created something new. The English
#. phrase uses placeholders for the follower's name, followed type, and
#. followed object, which are preserved in the Portuguese translation to
#. maintain consistency with the original context.
#: cm_main/followers.py:65
#, python-format
msgid ""
"%(follower_name)s has created a new %(followed_type)s "
"\"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr ""
"%(follower_name)s criou um novo %(followed_type)s: %(followed_object_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a new object of type obj_type has been added
#. to followed_type. The English sentence uses placeholders for the object
#. type, followed type, and object name, which are preserved in the Portuguese
#. translation to maintain consistency with the original context.
#: cm_main/followers.py:70 cm_main/tests/tests_followers.py:92
#, python-format
msgid "New %(obj_type)s added to %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr "Novo %(obj_type)s adicionado ao %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person added a new object to a category.
#. The English phrase "has added a new [object type] in the [followed type]
#. [followed object name]" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both adding an
#. object and categorizing it. The French translation makes it clear that it
#. is adding an object, so the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: cm_main/followers.py:75
#, python-format
msgid ""
"%(follower_name)s has added a new %(obj_type)s in the %(followed_type)s "
"\"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr ""
"%(follower_name)s adicionou um novo %(obj_type)s no %(followed_type)s "
"\"%(followed_object_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is no longer following or tracking
#. something. The English sentence uses a placeholder "{followed_type}" to
#. indicate the type of thing being followed, and the Portuguese version "Você
#. não está mais seguindo esse {followed_type}" maintains this same structure
#. and clarity.
#: cm_main/followers.py:108
#, python-brace-format
msgid "You are no longer following this {followed_type}"
msgstr "Você não está mais seguindo esse {followed_type}."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is currently following something.
#. The English sentence uses a placeholder for the type of thing being
#. followed, and the French translation makes it clear that it's about
#. following something.
#: cm_main/followers.py:111
#, python-brace-format
msgid "You are now following this {followed_type}"
msgstr "Você agora está seguindo este {followed_type}."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that there is a new follower for the specified type
#. (e.g. post, comment, etc.) with the given name. The English sentence uses
#. placeholders to indicate the type and object being referred to, while the
#. French translation makes it clear that it's about a new follower.
#: cm_main/followers.py:119 cm_main/tests/tests_followers.py:29
#, python-format
msgid "New follower to your %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr "Novo seguidor para o seu %(followed_type)s \"%(followed_object_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is now following something. The
#. English phrase "is now following your [something]" can be ambiguous, as it
#. can mean both "following someone" and "following something". The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is a thing being followed, so the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: cm_main/followers.py:121
#, python-format
msgid ""
"%(follower_name)s is now following your %(followed_type)s "
"\"%(followed_object_name)s\""
msgstr ""
"%(follower_name)s está agora seguindo seu %(followed_type)s "
"\"%(followed_object_name)s"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Your message" is a common way to refer to
#. an incoming message, while the French phrase "Ton message" also implies
#. that it's from you. In Portuguese, we use "mensagem" instead of "message",
#. and add the possessive suffix "-u" to indicate it belongs to you.
#: cm_main/forms.py:8
msgid "Your message"
msgstr "Seu mensagem"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which emphasizes brevity and avoiding images. The English sentence
#. is clear in its request to keep the content concise and image-free, so the
#. Portuguese version maintains this same tone and clarity.
#: cm_main/forms.py:9
msgid "Please keep it short and avoid images."
msgstr "Por favor, mantenha-o curto e evite imagens."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Attach file" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, such as attaching a physical file or making an attachment
#. in digital communication. The French translation "Attacher un fichier"
#. makes it clear that the action is related to digital communication, where a
#. file is attached to a message or document.
#: cm_main/forms.py:10
msgid "Attach file"
msgstr "Colocar arquivo"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that attaching a file is optional and only
#. necessary in certain situations. The English sentence's tone suggests a
#. general instruction, while the French translation makes it clear that
#. attachment is not mandatory.
#: cm_main/forms.py:11
msgid "You can attach a file here if needed"
msgstr "Você pode anexar um arquivo aqui se necessário"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation. The English phrase "Site
#. Statistics" can be slightly ambiguous, but in this context, it seems to
#. refer to statistical data about a website, making the Portuguese version
#. "Estatísticas do site" a fitting choice.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/about/site-stats.html:3
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/about/site-stats.html:6
msgid "Site Statistics"
msgstr "Estatísticas do site"

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same meaning and
#. structure as the French original, indicating that the webpage is displaying
#. statistical information about the current website.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/about/site-stats.html:7
msgid "This page displays some statistics about this site:"
msgstr "Esta página exibe algumas estatísticas sobre este site :"

#. Explanation: The English word "Statistics" and the French word
#. "Statistiques" are cognates, meaning they share a common origin. Both words
#. refer to the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and
#. organization of data. In Portuguese, the translation is "Estatísticas",
#. which maintains the same meaning as the original English sentence.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/about/site-stats.html:9
msgid "Statistics"
msgstr "Estatísticas"

#. Explanation: The English word "Home" can refer to a physical house or
#. dwelling, but in this context, it seems to be referring to the home page of
#. a website. The French translation "Accueil" also implies a webpage, so the
#. Portuguese translation "Casa" is used to maintain consistency with the
#. contextual translation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:8
msgid "Home"
msgstr "Casa"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which emphasizes pride and ownership in building a website. The
#. English phrase "This site proudly built using" suggests that the website
#. was constructed with pride, while the French phrase "Ce site est fièrement
#. propulsé par" makes it clear that the website is being propelled or driven
#. by something ( likely a content management system or CMS), which is also
#. reflected in the Portuguese translation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:68
msgid "This site proudly built using"
msgstr "Este site foi construído com orgulho"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the source code has a license attached to it.
#. The English phrase "The source code is licensed" can be ambiguous, as it
#. can mean both "the source code exists" and "the source code has a license".
#. The French translation makes it clear that it is a license, so the
#. Portuguese version "O código-fonte está licenciado." follows this
#. interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:70
msgid "The source code is licensed"
msgstr "O código-fonte está licenciado."

#. Explanation: The original English phrase uses the symbol "© " to indicate
#. copyright, which is not necessary in Portuguese. The French translation
#. already omits this symbol, so the Portuguese version follows suit.
#. Additionally, the word "reserved" is translated to "reservados", which is
#. the correct Portuguese term for the same concept.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:76
msgid "Copyright © 2024 Cousins Matter. All rights reserved."
msgstr "Copyright 2024 Cousins Matter. Todos os direitos reservados."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and formal way to ask someone to contact the site
#. administrator. The English phrase "Contact the site admin" can be slightly
#. more informal, but the Portuguese version "Contate o administrador do site"
#. maintains the same level of formality as the French original.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/base.html:79
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:116
msgid "Contact the site admin"
msgstr "Contate o administrador do site"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is to verify or validate something. The English word
#. "Confirm" also carries this same meaning, so the Portuguese version
#. "Confirmar" follows this interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:28
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:54
msgid "Confirm"
msgstr "Confirmar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Cancel" and the French word "Annuler" both
#. convey the idea of stopping or reversing an action, but they have slightly
#. different connotations. In English, "Cancel" can imply a more formal or
#. official cancellation, whereas in French, "Annuler" has a broader meaning
#. that includes not only cancellations but also negating or rejecting
#. something. The Portuguese translation "Cancelar" maintains the same level
#. of formality and universality as the original English word.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:32
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:58
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:16
msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Cancelar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user needs to enter a specific value into
#. a field before confirming. The HTML class "has-text-danger" is preserved in
#. the translation to maintain consistency with the original text's visual
#. styling.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:40
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Enter \"<span class=\"has-text-danger\">%(expected_value)s</span>\" in the "
"field below before pressing confirm"
msgstr ""
"Insira `<span class=\\\"has-text-danger\\\">%(expected_value)s</span>` no "
"campo abaixo antes de pressionar confirmar."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that deletion will not occur until the correct
#. value is entered. The English sentence "Mandatory. Deletion will not take
#. place until the correct value is entered" can be ambiguous, as it can mean
#. both "mandatory" and "deletion". The French translation makes it clear that
#. it is a requirement for deletion to occur, so the Portuguese version
#. "Obrigatório. A exclusão não ocorrerá até que o valor correto seja
#. inserido." follows this interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/confirm-delete-modal.html:48
msgid ""
"Mandatory. Deletion will not take place until the correct value is entered."
msgstr ""
"Obrigatório. A exclusão não ocorrerá até que a valor correto seja inserido."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the toggle action is for showing or hiding the
#. toolbar. The English phrase "Toggle Note Editor Toolbar" suggests a switch
#. between two states (showing and hiding), so the Portuguese version "Barra
#. de ferramentas do Editor de Notas" follows this interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/include-summernote.html:6
msgid "Toggle Note Editor Toolbar"
msgstr "Barra de ferramentas do Editor de Notas"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that there are remaining or unused characters. The
#. English phrase "Remaining characters" is a common term used in programming
#. and text editing contexts to refer to the characters that have not been
#. used yet.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/include-summernote.html:7
msgid "Remaining characters:"
msgstr "Caracteres restantes:"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a common way to express the concept of items per page in
#. many languages. The English phrase "Items per page" is also widely used and
#. understood, but the Portuguese version "Quantidade por página" follows the
#. same semantic meaning as the French translation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:20
msgid "Items per page:"
msgstr "Quantidade por página"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "go to first page" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, such as navigating to the first page of a document or
#. website. However, the French translation "aller à la 1ère page" makes it
#. clear that the action is to go to the first page, which is a common
#. idiomatic expression. The Portuguese translation "Ir para a primeira
#. página" follows this interpretation and uses the verb "ir" (to go) in the
#. correct context.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:40
msgid "go to first page"
msgstr "Ir para a primeira página"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "go to page #%(page_num)s" can be
#. interpreted as both "going to a specific page" and "going to the next
#. page". However, in this context, it seems that the intention is to refer to
#. a specific page. The French translation "aller à la page #%(page_num)s"
#. makes it clear that the speaker intends to go to a specific page, which is
#. why the Portuguese translation uses the verb "ir para", meaning "to go to".
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:52
#, python-format
msgid "go to page #%(page_num)s"
msgstr "ir para a página #%(page_num)s"

#. Explanation: The English phrase contains a placeholder for the page number,
#. which is preserved in the Portuguese translation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:55
#, python-format
msgid "page #%(page_num)s"
msgstr "página #( %(page_num)s )"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates going to the last page. The English phrase "go to
#. last page" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "going to the last page"
#. and "going back to the previous page". However, in this context, where the
#. user is likely asking to navigate to the final page of a document or list,
#. the translation "Ir para a última página" accurately conveys the intended
#. meaning.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/common/paginate_template.html:68
msgid "go to last page"
msgstr "Ir para a última página"

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same meaning and tone
#. as the French original, using the word "contato" to convey the idea of a
#. contact form.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:6
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:9
msgid "Contact Form"
msgstr "Formulário de contato"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is polite and formal. The English sentence is a request for
#. the user to fill out a form, while the French translation adds a touch of
#. politeness with "Merci" (thank you) at the beginning.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:10
msgid "Please fill out the form below to contact the admin of this site:"
msgstr ""
"Por favor, preencha o formulário abaixo para entrar em contato com o "
"administrador deste site :"

#. Explanation: This translation reflects the meaning of the French phrase,
#. which is a direct and literal translation of the English word "Send". The
#. verb "Enviar" in Portuguese means to send or transmit something.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/contact-form.html:15
msgid "Send"
msgstr "Enviar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the sender sent a message from a specific
#. website. The English phrase "%(sender_name)s sent you the following message
#. from %(site_name)s:" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "sent to you"
#. and "from". The French translation makes it clear that it is from, so the
#. Portuguese version "s enviou-lhe o seguinte mensagem do site %s:" follows
#. this interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/email-contact-form.html:19
#: cm_main/tests/test_contactform.py:42
#, python-format
msgid "%(sender_name)s sent you the following message from %(site_name)s:"
msgstr "%(sender_name)s enviou-lhe a seguinte mensagem de %(site_name)s:"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person can respond directly to the email
#. to answer him/her. The English sentence is slightly ambiguous, as it could
#. mean both "responding directly to this email" and "answering someone who
#. has sent an email". The French translation makes it clear that it is a
#. response to the email, so the Portuguese version follows this
#. interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/contact/email-contact-form.html:26
msgid "You can directly reply to this email to answer him/her."
msgstr ""
"Você pode responder diretamente a este e-mail para responder a ele(a)."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the author created a specific type of content
#. (followed_type) with a link to its URL. The English sentence uses
#. placeholders for the object name and URL, but the French translation omits
#. these placeholders, suggesting that they are already included in the text.
#. Therefore, the Portuguese version maintains this consistency by not
#. translating the placeholders.

"href=\"%(followed_object_url)s'>\"%(followed_object_name)s\"</a>:"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the author added a specific object to a
#. certain type. The English sentence uses placeholders for the object name
#. and URL, but the French translation makes it clear that it is an addition
#. to a specific type, so the Portuguese version "%(author_name)s adicionou o
#. seguinte %(obj_type)s no %(followed_type)s <a
#. href="%(followed_object_url)s">'%(followed_object_name)s'</a>:") follows
#. this interpretation.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the email is automated and should not be
#. replied to. The English sentence "Do not reply to this mail, it is machine
#. generated" makes it clear that the response is not expected from a human,
#. so the Portuguese version "Não responda a este e-mail, ele foi gerado por
#. uma máquina." follows this interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/email-followers-on-change.html:32
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/new_follower.html:27
msgid "Do not reply to this mail, it is machine generated."

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same format as the

#. entity being referred to as "membro".

#, python-format
msgid "%(nfollowers)s member"
msgid_plural "%(nfollowers)s members"
msgstr[0] "%(nfollowers)s membro"
msgstr[1] "%(nfollowers)s membros"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a person who follows another. The English phrase
#. "%(nfollowers)s follower" uses a placeholder to indicate the number of
#. followers, and the Portuguese version "%(nfollowers)s seguidor" maintains
#. this format while translating the word "follower".
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/followers-count-tag.html:10
#, python-format
msgid "%(nfollowers)s follower"
msgid_plural "%(nfollowers)s followers"
msgstr[0] "%(nfollowers)s seguidor"
msgstr[1] "%(nfollowers)s seguidores"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person has gained a new follower. The
#. English phrase "Your %(followed_type)s '%(followed_object_name)s' has a new
#. follower!" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "gaining a new follower"
#. and "having a new follower". The French translation makes it clear that it
#. is gaining a new follower, so the Portuguese version "Seu %(followed_type)s
#. '%(followed_object_name)s' tem um novo seguidor!" follows this
#. interpretation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/new_follower.html:14
#, python-format

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is now following the followed type
#. on the followed object. The English sentence contains placeholders for the
#. follower name, followed type, followed URL, followed object name, and site
#. name, which are preserved in the Portuguese translation to maintain
#. consistency with the original context.

"href=\"%(followed_url)s\">\"%(followed_object_name)s\"</a> em %(site_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the action of following should be stopped. The
#. English phrase "Stop Following" is clear and direct in its intention to
#. stop the act of following someone or something. The Portuguese version
#. "Parar de seguir" conveys a similar sense of finality and completion,
#. making it an accurate translation.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/toggle-follow-button.html:4
msgid "Stop Following"
msgstr "Parar de seguir"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Follow" can have different meanings, such
#. as to track someone's movements or to accompany them. However, the French
#. translation "Suivre" implies a more general meaning of following or
#. tracking, which is consistent with the Portuguese translation "Seguir".
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/followers/toggle-follow-button.html:11
msgid "Follow"
msgstr "Seguir"

#. Explanation: The English word "members" can refer to individuals who belong
#. to a group or organization, but the French translation "membres" is more
#. general and can also mean "members" in a broader sense, such as members of
#. a committee or council. In this case, the Portuguese translation "membros"
#. maintains the same level of generality.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:26 cm_main/views/views_stats.py:106
msgid "Members"
msgstr "membros"

#. Explanation: The English term "Birthdays" can refer to the anniversary of
#. one's birth, but it can also be used more broadly to refer to any birthday.
#. In this case, the French translation "Anniversaires" is a more general term
#. that encompasses all types of birthdays, whereas "Data de nascimento" in
#. Portuguese specifically refers to the date of birth.
#: cm_main/templates/cm_main/navbar.html:29
msgid "Birthdays"
msgstr "Data de nascimento"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the action is to show or display the
#. directory. The English phrase "Show directory" is a direct and clear
#. instruction, and the Portuguese version "Mostrar diretório" conveys the
#. same sense of purpose.

#. Explanation: The English word "chat" can have multiple meanings, including

#. could refer to both public spaces for chatting and online communities.
#. However, the French translation "Salons de discussion publique" suggests a
#. more specific meaning, implying a dedicated space for public discussions or
#. meetings. This interpretation is consistent with the French translation,
#. which uses the word "salon", typically referring to a meeting room or a

msgid "Public Chat Rooms"
msgstr "Salas de chat público"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Private Chat Rooms" can be ambiguous, as
#. it could refer to both private chat rooms and private conversation spaces.
#. However, the French translation "Salons de discussion privée" makes it
#. clear that it is a space for private discussions, which is more specific
#. and accurate. Therefore, the Portuguese translation "Salas de privacidade
#. para conversação" follows this interpretation, emphasizing the private

#. phrase "You have a new message from %(name)s (%(email)s)" can be ambiguous,
#. as it can mean both "you have a new message" and "the sender is unknown".
#. However, in this context, where the name and email are provided, it's clear
#. that the message is being sent by someone specific. The French translation
#. makes it explicit that the recipient has received a new message from a
#. known sender, so the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the mailer tools are outdated and cannot
#. display the information. The English sentence "But your mailer tools is too
#. old to show it :'(" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "but your mailer
#. tools are outdated" and "but you're showing something that's too old". The
#. French translation makes it clear that it is about the age of the tools, so
#. the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.

msgid "Version not found"

#: cm_main/views/views_stats.py:55
msgid "Your version is not up-to-date."
msgstr "Seu último lançamento não está atualizado."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the speaker is comparing versions and stating
#. that the current version is newer than the latest release. The English
#. sentence contains an exclamation mark (!) at the end, which suggests strong
#. emotions or emphasis, but in this context, it's likely being used to convey
#. a sense of surprise or comparison.

msgid "Your version is newer than the latest release (?!?)"
msgstr "Seu versão é mais nova do que a última versão lançada (?!?)"
