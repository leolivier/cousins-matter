#. Explanation: The French translation "Aujourd'hui" is used to indicate the
#. current day, whereas the English phrase "Today" can be used in various
#. contexts. In Portuguese, "Hoje" is a more general term that encompasses
#. both the current day and other instances of today, such as referring to a
#. specific date or time period.
msgid "Today"
msgstr "Hoje"

#. Explanation: The English word "Clear" can have different meanings, such as
#. being transparent or free from obstacles. In this context, the Portuguese
#. translation "Limpo" is more literal and conveys the idea of something being
#. clean or free from impurities, which aligns with the French translation
#. "Effacer", suggesting to remove or erase something.
msgid "Clear"
msgstr "Limpo"

#. Explanation: The English word "Cancel" can have different meanings, such as
#. to stop or to void an action. However, in the context of the French
#. translation "Annuler", it seems that the intended meaning is to cancel or
#. void an action, which is a common usage in both languages.
msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Cancelar"

#. Explanation: The French translation "Maintenant" can also mean "now" in a
#. more formal or literal sense, but the Portuguese translation "Agora" is
#. more commonly used to indicate the present moment.
msgid "Now"
msgstr "Agora"

#. Explanation: The English word "Validate" and the French word "Valider" both
#. convey the meaning of making something valid or true. There is no
#. significant difference in their usage, so the Portuguese translation
#. "Validar" maintains consistency with the French translation.
msgid "Validate"
msgstr "Validar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Delete" can have different meanings
#. depending on the context, such as deleting a file or deleting an account.
#. However, in general, it means to remove or get rid of something. In
#. Portuguese, the word "Apagar" is used to convey this meaning, and it is
#. consistent with the French translation "Supprimer", which also implies
#. removal or elimination.
msgid "Delete"
msgstr "Apagar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a polite and formal way of asking if someone is sure they
#. want to delete a comment. The English sentence is also phrased in a similar
#. manner, making it clear that the question is about deleting a comment.
msgid "Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"
msgstr "Você está seguro de querer apagar esse comentário?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a more formal and polite way to ask if someone is sure
#. they want to delete something. The English sentence is a bit more direct
#. and informal, while the French translation adds a touch of politeness with
#. the use of "sûr(e)" (sure) and the question mark at the end.
msgid "Are you sure you want to delete this reply and its comments?"
msgstr "Você está seguro de querer apagar essa resposta e seus comentários?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the content of the message is too large and
#. suggests selecting smaller images to resolve the issue. The original
#. English sentence can be ambiguous, but the French translation makes it
#. clear, so the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
msgid "The message content is too large. Please select smaller images."
msgstr ""
"O conteúdo do mensagem é muito grande. Por favor, selecione imagens menores."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a polite and formal way of asking if someone is sure they
#. want to delete a message. The English sentence is also phrased in a similar
#. manner, making it clear that the question is about deleting a message.
msgid "Are you sure you want to delete this message?"
msgstr "Você está seguro de querer apagar essa mensagem?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a deletion has been confirmed. The English
#. phrase and French translation convey a sense of finality and confirmation,
#. so the Portuguese version maintains this tone.
msgid "Deletion confirmed..."
msgstr "Confirmação de exclusão..."

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same tone and
#. emphasis as the original English sentence, conveying a sense of surprise or
#. frustration that the message was empty.
msgid "The message was empty!"
msgstr "O mensagem estava vazia!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Not valid!" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, but the French translation "Non valide !" makes it clear
#. that it's an expression of invalidity or unreliability. In Portuguese, the
#. word "não" is used to indicate negation, and "válido" means valid, so the
#. translation "Não válido" accurately conveys this meaning.
msgid "Not valid!"
msgstr "Não válido!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation of the English sentence.
#. The placeholder "%s" is kept in its original position to maintain
#. consistency with both the English and French translations.
msgid "%s answer"
msgid_plural "%s answers"
msgstr[0] "%s resposta"
msgstr[1] "%s responde"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a question about something. The English phrase "%s
#. comment" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "how" and "what". However,
#. in this context, it seems to be asking for a commentary or an explanation.
#. The French translation makes it clear that it is a request for a
#. commentary, so the Portuguese version ":%s comentário" follows this
#. interpretation.
msgid "%s comment"
msgid_plural "%s comments"
msgstr[0] "%s comentário"
msgstr[1] "%s comentários"

#. Explanation: The English word "profile" and the French word "profil" both
#. refer to a person's or thing's outline, shape, or characteristics. In this
#. context, the Portuguese translation "perfil" maintains the same meaning as
#. the original words.
msgid "profile"
msgstr "Perfil"
