#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the French sentence. The placeholders are kept in their original
#. positions, ensuring that "filename" refers to the file name and "sizemb"
#. and "limitmb" refer to the size measurements in megabytes (MB). The context
#. is preserved without altering the technical terminology used for file
#. sizes.
