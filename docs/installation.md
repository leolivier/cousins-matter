# Installation of Cousins Matter

This has been tested on Linux and Windows+WSL2 with Ubuntu or Debian + Docker Desktop installed. (The install script has not yet been tested on MacOS, but should work with very few changes)

## Production installation

### Prerequisites

If not already done, install Docker on your server:
```
curl https://get.docker.com | sh
```

You will also need a Python 3.12+ environment to run the Cousins Matter admin script.

### Download and run the Cousins Matter admin script

Please replace in the link below the <release\> placeholder with the current release of Cousins Matter:
![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/leolivier/cousins-matter?style=for-the-badge&label=current%20release&labelColor=%23f00&color=%23ffff)

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leolivier/cousins-matter/refs/tags/<release>/scripts/manage_cousins_matter.py
python manage_cousins_matter.py install [-d <directory>] [-r <release>]
```

* if -d directory is not given, it will install in the current directory
* if -r release is not given, it will install the latest release

This command will:

* download the necessary files for Cousins Matter;
* create the necessary directories;
* create the base .env file from an example;
* run an editor on the .env file to suit your needs (see the [Settings](settings.md) page). In particular, don't forget to add the information to create the superuser.

This script can also help you to [migrate from v1 to v2 version of Cousins Matter](migrate-from-v1-to-v2.md) and to [rotate your secret key from time to time](other-management-operations.md#rotate-your-secret-key).

To get the different commands available, run:

```
python manage_cousins_matter.py -h
```

To get help for a specific command, run:
```
python manage_cousins_matter.py <command> -h
```

### Start Cousins Matter

```
cd <directory>
docker compose up -d
```

__The first time__, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/profile, log in using the admin account that you have just created and complete your profile.

**And you're done!**

## Build from source

* Install Docker

	```
	curl https://get.docker.com | sh
	```

* Clone the git repo:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/mariocesar/cousins-matter.git
	cd cousins-matter
	```

* Install the dependencies:

	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

	> __It is advised to do this in a virtual environment (using pip env, uv or conda).__

* Update your settings:
	Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit `.env` to set the properties according to your needs, see the [Settings](settings.md) page.
	You can automatically create the SECRET_KEY by running the following command:

	```
	./manage_cousins_matter.sh rotate-secrets
	```

* build the docker image:

	```
	docker build -t cousins-matter:local .
	```

* Update the docker-compose.yml file to use the local image by adding the following line to the .env file:
	```
	COUSINS_MATTER_IMAGE=cousins-matter:local
	```

* Start everything:

	```
	docker compose up -d
	```
 
### Run it outside Docker

if you want to debug your installation, you can run it outside Docker.

For this, you'll need to start postgresql and redis using the docker-compose.yml file:

```
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

To allow the app to use redis and postgres, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

```
export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
export REDIS_HOST=localhost
```

Then, run the following commands:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

or start debugging from your IDE (the project is already configured for Visual Studio Code in the .vscode/launch.json file)
