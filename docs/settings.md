## Introduction
The settings of Cousins Matter can be managed using a `.env` file in the main directory of the application.

If you have used the manage_cousins_matter.py script to install Cousins Matter as described in [Installation](installation.md), an example .env file has been downloaded for you automatically and the SECRET_KEY and the POSTGRES_PASSWORD have been generated automatically (**don't overwrite them!**).

If you are working from source, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` 

In both cases, you now need to edit `.env` to set the properties according to your context as described below.

There are many settings available to customize the technical part of your site... 

Also, don't forget to check out [Customization](customizing.md) to customize the look and feel of your site.

**WARNING**: If the container is already running, the update of the settings in .env won't be taken into account until you restart it. 
To do that, just run the following command (in the site directory): 
```
docker compose restart
```

## Security
* `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key that protects your site. Must be outrageously complex and kept secret! The easiest way to generate it is to run `python manage_cousins_matter.py rotate-secrets`. This script will also update the PREVIOUS_SECRET_KEYS in the .env file. This variable is used to decode the tokens that have been sent to members with the previous secret key.

	_(Again, if you used manage_cousins_matter.py to install Cousins Matter, this has already been generated for you, don't overwrite it)_
* `MAX_REGISTRATION_AGE`: Maximum validity in seconds for invitation tokens, default is 2 days (2*24*3600)

## Superuser
Before running `docker compose up -d` the first time, provide the information to create the superuser (ie the admin account).
* `ADMIN`: the superuser account name
* `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: the superuser password
* `ADMIN_EMAIL`: the superuser email
* `ADMIN_FIRSTNAME`: the superuser first name
* `ADMIN_LASTNAME`: the superuser last name

**ALL THESE VARIABLES ARE MANDATORY TO CREATE THE SUPERUSER ACCOUNT AND HAVE NO DEFAULT VALUES**

If you forgot to provide this information before starting `docker compose up -d`, you can still create it by running 
```
docker exec -it cousins-matter python manage.py createsuperuser
```
It will ask you the parameters interactively.

## Features Management
You can manage the features that will be offered to members in the .env file.

To do so, modify the FEATURES_FLAGS variable based on the contents of the .env.example file and set the value of each feature to be ignored to false.

The default value of FEATURES_FLAGS is:
```
FEATURES_FLAGS="show_birthdays_in_homepage=True;show_galleries=True;show_forums=True;show_chats=True;show_classified_ads=True;show_polls=True;show_event_planners=True;show_pages=True;show_treasures=True;show_privacy_policy=True;show_site_stats=True;show_import_members=True;show_export_members=True"`
```
**WARNINGS:**
1. The variable INCLUDE_BIRTHDAYS_IN_HOMEPAGE has been replaced by the feature flag show_birthdays_in_homepage, as shown above.
2. The FEATURES_FLAGS must stay on one line in the .env file. All flags are separated by semicolons. If you set this variable in your .env file and a flag is not present in the list, it is considered false.
