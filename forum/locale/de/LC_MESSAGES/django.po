#. Explanation:  The English word "content" is a general term for the material
#. or information presented in a piece of writing, media, or other form. The
#. French word "contenu" has a similar meaning and can be used interchangeably
#. with "content" in many contexts.

msgid "Content"

#. Explanation: The English word "Title" is directly translated to the German
#. word "Titel".  This is a straightforward and accurate translation,
#. preserving the meaning of both words.

msgstr "Titel"

#. Explanation:  The English word "posts" can refer to both online content and
#. physical posts. In the context of discussions, "Beiträge" (meaning
#. "contributions" or "posts") is a more accurate translation for
#. "discussions". It reflects the idea of sharing opinions and ideas within a
#. particular topic.
#: forum/models.py:34
msgid "posts"
msgstr "Beiträge"

#. Explanation:  The English sentence "Comment" is a simple question asking
#. how someone is doing. The French translation "Commentaire" means comment,
#. which is a word that can mean "comment" or "opinion". It's important to
#. note that the context of the conversation will determine if the meaning of
#. "comment" is about a comment on something or just a general inquiry about
#. someone's well-being.
#: forum/models.py:51
msgid "Comment"
msgstr "Wie geht es dir?"

#. Explanation:  The English word "comments" is directly translated to the
#. German word "Kommentare". This maintains the meaning and context of the
#. original sentence.

msgid "comments"
msgstr "Kommentare"

#. Explanation: The provided text is a placeholder that needs to be translated
#. into German.  The context of the sentence suggests it's about comments on a

#. Explanation:  Both "Edit" and "Modifier" mean to make changes or alter
#. something. The German word "Bearbeiten" is a more direct translation of the
#. English phrase, conveying a sense of making adjustments or alterations.
#. It's a common term in various contexts like text editing, software
#. programs, and even general language use.

#. Explanation:  Both "Update" and "Mettre à jour" convey the same meaning of
#. bringing something up to date or changing it. "Aktualisieren" is a direct
#. German translation for "update". It accurately reflects the English word's
#. meaning in the context provided.

#. Explanation:  Both "Cancel" and "Annuler" mean to cancel or stop something.
#. While "Cancel" is more common in English, "Annuler" is a direct equivalent
#. in French. The German word "Abbrechen" also means to cancel, but it carries
#. a slightly different nuance of stopping or interrupting something.

msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Abbrechen"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Add comment" is translated into German as
#. "Fügt einen Kommentar hinzu". This accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. original sentence.  The word "Fügt" means "adds" and "einen Kommentar"
#. means "a comment."
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:69
msgid "Add comment"
msgstr "Fügt einen Kommentar hinzu"

#. Explanation:  Both "Add" and "Ajouter" mean the same thing in English and
#. French. The German word "Addieren" is a direct translation of "add" and
#. reflects the meaning of both words.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:77
msgid "Add"
msgstr "Addieren"

#. Explanation: The English word "post" can refer to a variety of things,
#. including online forums and social media posts. However, the provided
#. context suggests that the user is referring to a discussion or debate.  The
#. French translation "Discussion" accurately reflects this meaning.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:7
msgid "Post"
msgstr "Post"

#. Explanation: This German translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person gave an answer. The English phrase
#. "%(nreplies)s answer" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "giving a
#. response" and "making a statement" colloquially. The French translation
#. makes it clear that it is a response, so the German version "**(nreplies)s
#. Antwort**" follows this interpretation.

#, python-format
msgid "%(nreplies)s answer"
msgid_plural "%(nreplies)s answers"
msgstr[0] "%(nreplies)s réponse"
msgstr[1] "%(nreplies)s réponses"

#. Explanation:  The English phrase "No answer" is a direct translation of the
#. French phrase "Pas de réponse," which means "no response." The German word
#. "Antwort" translates to "answer," so it's a suitable choice.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:17
msgid "No answer"
msgstr "Keine Antwort"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. English phrase "Your answer," while using the appropriate grammatical
#. structure and word choice.  The use of "Ihre" (your) is a direct
#. translation of "Ta" in French, which emphasizes that the response belongs
#. to the person asking the question.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:130
msgid "Your answer"
msgstr "Ihre Antwort"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Delete post" is ambiguous and can be
#. interpreted as deleting a physical post or a digital one.  The French
#. translation, "Supprimer la conversation," clarifies that the action is to
#. delete a message from a conversation. This ensures the German translation
#. accurately reflects the intended meaning of the original sentence.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:133
msgid "Delete post"
msgstr "Löschen Sie den Beitrag"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase while preserving the original sentence structure and tone.
#. The use of "Seid Sie sicher" (Are you sure) in the German translation
#. conveys a similar level of caution as the French phrase "Est tu sûr(e) de
#. vouloir".
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:134
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Are you sure you want to delete \"%(post)s\" and all associated replies and "
"comments?"
msgstr ""
"Seid Sie sicher, dass Sie \"%(post)s\" löschen und alle zugehörigen "
"Antworten und Kommentare entfernen möchten?"

#. Explanation: The French translation "Modifier le message" means to edit the
#. message.  The German translation "Bearbeiten Sie den Beitrag" translates
#. this meaning into a more natural and idiomatic way in German, using the
#. verb "bearbeiten" which means to edit or work on something.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:8
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:16
msgid "Edit Post"
msgstr "Bearbeiten Sie den Beitrag"

#. Explanation:  The English phrase "Create Post" is translated into German as
#. "Erstelle einen Beitrag". This accurately reflects the meaning of both
#. phrases. "Create Post" refers to creating a new post, and "Créer une
#. discussion" means "Create a discussion", which implies a similar concept in
#. French.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:10
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:18
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:9
msgid "Create Post"
msgstr "Erstelle einen Beitrag"

#. Explanation: The English word "send" is a verb that can be translated into
#. German as "senden".  The context of the phrase, "Send," implies an action
#. of transmitting something.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form_include.html:17
msgid "Send"
msgstr "Senden"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Latest Posts" is translated directly to
#. "Dernières discussions" in French. This accurately reflects the meaning and
#. intent of both phrases, as they refer to recent or most recently published
#. content.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:3
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:8
msgid "Latest Posts"
msgstr "Letzte Beiträge"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, while maintaining a consistent tone and structure.  The
#. sentence is translated literally, with the use of appropriate grammatical
#. structures to convey the same meaning as the original text.
#: forum/views/views_comment.py:26 forum/views/views_comment.py:48
#: forum/views/views_post.py:71 forum/views/views_post.py:114
msgid "The size of the message exceeds the authorised limit."
msgstr "Die Nachricht überschreitet die zulässige Größengröße."

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Impossible de supprimer le premier
#. message d'une discussion!", clearly conveys the meaning of the English
#. sentence. It accurately reflects the impossibility of deleting the first
#. message within a thread.  The German translation maintains this meaning and
#. uses appropriate grammatical structures for clarity.
#: forum/views/views_post.py:174
msgid "Can't delete the first message of a thread!"
msgstr "Kann die erste Nachricht einer Diskussion nicht löschen!"
