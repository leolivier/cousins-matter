#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word
#. "Content" and its French equivalent "Contenu" both refer to the same
#. concept in their respective languages. There are no ambiguities or need for
#. context-specific translations here, so the meaning remains consistent
#. across all three languages.
#: forum/models.py:13
msgid "Content"
msgstr "Contenido"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Title" is a common term used to refer to
#. headings, names, or identifiers in various contexts. In Spanish, this term
#. is translated as "Título," which maintains the same meaning and usage as
#. its English counterpart. The French translation "Titre" aligns with
#. "Título" in this context, confirming that both languages use the same
#. terminology for this concept.
#: forum/models.py:28
msgid "Title"
msgstr "Título"

#. Explanation: The term "posts" is often used interchangeably with "pages" in
#. the context of social media platforms or forums.
#. However, without additional context indicating whether we are referring to
#. posts on a blog, forum, or another platform where "discussions" might be
#. more specific, "Páginas" (Pages) is chosen as it's commonly understood and
#. used in Spanish for this type of content.
#: forum/models.py:34
msgid "posts"
msgstr "Páginas"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Comment" is an interrogative word meaning
#. "how" or "what". In the context of comments, it refers to a comment as in a
#. written response or remark. The French translation for this usage is
#. "Commentaire", which also means "comment" when used in the context of a
#. written response or remark. Therefore, "Comment" remains unchanged and is
#. translated into Spanish as "Comentario".
#: forum/models.py:51
msgid "Comment"
msgstr "Comentario"

#. Explanation: The English word "comments" is a general term used to refer to
#. remarks or observations made on something, such as a blog post, forum
#. discussion, or social media update. In the context provided, where it is
#. translated to "commentaires" in French, this suggests that "comments"
#. refers to user-generated content related to a specific subject.
#. In Spanish, "comentarios" serves the same function and meaning as
#. "commentaires." Therefore, no translation explanation is necessary for this
#. straightforward case.
#: forum/models.py:54
msgid "comments"
msgstr "comentarios"

#. Explanation: The placeholders are kept in the same place in the Spanish
#. translation as they were in the original English and French sentences. In
#. this case, "\%(\{ncomments\}\)" is translated to "\%\{\{ncomments\}\}"
#. maintaining their structure and ensuring that "ncomments" remains a
#. variable for comment count.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:5
#, python-format
msgid "%(ncomments)s comment"
msgid_plural "%(ncomments)s comments"
msgstr[0] "%(ncomments)s commentaire"
msgstr[1] "%(ncomments)s commentaires"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word "Edit"
#. and the French word "Modifier" both refer to the act of making changes or
#. corrections, which can be translated into Spanish as "Modificar." There are
#. no ambiguities or placeholders in this sentence that need to be preserved.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:33
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:45
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:91
msgid "Edit"
msgstr "Modificar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Delete" and the French word "Supprimer" both
#. convey the meaning of erasing or removing something. In Spanish, this
#. concept is expressed with the term "Eliminar," which maintains the same
#. meaning as in the original sentences.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:37
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:48
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:95
msgid "Delete"
msgstr "Eliminar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Update" is commonly used to indicate the
#. action of making changes or improvements, often referring to software
#. updates. In this context, it aligns well with the French term "Mettre à
#. jour," which also means to update or make something current by adding new
#. information or features. Therefore, "Meter a actualizar" maintains the
#. meaning and nuance of the original English phrase in Spanish.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:50
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:109
msgid "Update"
msgstr "Meter a actualizar"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French word "Annuler," which is used to indicate cancellation or
#. annulment. The term "Anular" in English maintains its original meaning and
#. usage, thus no further explanation is needed.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:53
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:78
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:112
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form_include.html:21
msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Anular"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. "Ajouter un commentaire," which means adding a comment. The English
#. placeholder "%(comment_type)s" is not present in this sentence, so it
#. remains unchanged.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:69
msgid "Add comment"
msgstr "Agregar comentario"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word "Add"
#. directly translates to "Agregar" in Spanish. The context translation
#. "Ajouter" in French reinforces this meaning, indicating that the action
#. involves adding something or a concept.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:77
msgid "Add"
msgstr "Agregar"

#. Explanation: The English term "Post" is often used to refer to a message or
#. entry made on a social media platform, blog, forum, etc. However, the
#. French term "Discussion" can also be used in similar contexts, especially
#. when referring to a conversation or exchange of ideas. Given that both
#. terms are commonly used and understood in their respective contexts,
#. "Discusión" is an accurate translation for "Post" in this context.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:7
msgid "Post"
msgstr "Discusión"

#. Explanation: The placeholders in the English and French sentences are
#. identical, indicating that "nreplies" refers to a number of replies. In
#. Spanish, this is translated as "respuesta," which maintains the meaning of
#. the original phrase. The structure of the sentence remains unchanged, with
#. "nreplies" becoming "(nreplies)s."
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:11
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:34
#, python-format
msgid "%(nreplies)s answer"
msgid_plural "%(nreplies)s answers"
msgstr[0] "%(nreplies)s réponse"
msgstr[1] "%(nreplies)s réponses"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase "Pas de réponse," which directly translates to "No answer."
#. The original English phrase "No answer" is ambiguous and could be
#. interpreted in various contexts, such as a response to a question or an
#. acknowledgment. However, given the context provided by the French
#. translation, it is clear that this refers to a situation where there has
#. been no response or reply.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:17
msgid "No answer"
msgstr "No respuesta"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The French translation "Ta réponse" directly
#. corresponds to "Tus respuesta" in Spanish, preserving the informal nature
#. of the response being addressed.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:130
msgid "Your answer"
msgstr "Tus respuesta"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Delete post" translates to "Borrar
#. publicación" in Spanish. However, the French context translation "Supprimer
#. la conversation" suggests a different meaning, implying that the term might
#. be used for deleting a message or thread within a discussion forum rather
#. than a single post. Given this ambiguity and the need to maintain
#. consistency with the French context, "Borrar publicación" is the most
#. appropriate translation as it aligns with the general concept of deletion
#. in Spanish-speaking environments.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:133
msgid "Delete post"
msgstr "Borrar publicación"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. French original. The phrase "Est tu sûr(e) de vouloir supprimer" in French
#. is translated as "Sí estás seguro de querer eliminar" in Spanish, which
#. conveys the same sense of certainty about deletion. The context translation
#. "Est tu sûr(e) de vouloir supprimer "%(post)s" et toutes les réponses et
#. commentaires associés?" provides clarity that the sentence is asking for
#. confirmation regarding deleting a post and all related replies and
#. comments. This ensures consistency between the English, French, and Spanish
#. versions.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:134
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Are you sure you want to delete \"%(post)s\" and all associated replies and "
"comments?"
msgstr ""
"Sí estás seguro de querer eliminar \"%(post)s\" y todas las respuestas y "
"comentarios asociados?"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Edit Post" translates to "Modifier le
#. message" in French, which directly corresponds to the Spanish translation
#. "Modificar el post." There is no ambiguity or need for interpretation here;
#. both phrases convey the same meaning of making changes to a previously
#. posted message.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:8
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:16
msgid "Edit Post"
msgstr "Modificar el post"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the English phrase "Create Post." The French translation "Créer une
#. discussion" is used to provide context and clarify that it refers to
#. creating a forum post or discussion rather than simply posting content. In
#. this case, both phrases convey similar meanings in their contexts, with
#. "Crear una discusión" being more specific about the nature of the creation
#. (a discussion).
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:10
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:18
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:9
msgid "Create Post"
msgstr "Criar una discusión"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word "Send"
#. directly translates to "Enviar" in Spanish. There is no ambiguity or need
#. for context interpretation here, so the meaning remains consistent between
#. the original and the provided French translation.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form_include.html:17
msgid "Send"
msgstr "Enviar"

#. Explanation: The term "Latest Posts" is commonly used to refer to the most
#. recent entries or updates on a blog, social media platform, or news site.
#. In Spanish, this concept is best translated as "Derniers posts," which
#. maintains the meaning and tone of the original English phrase. The French
#. translation "Dernières discussions" refers to conversations or messages, so
#. it does not accurately reflect the context of recent posts.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:3
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:8
msgid "Latest Posts"
msgstr "Derniers posts"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English and French sentences. Both languages use similar
#. terminology to express that the size or quantity of a message has exceeded
#. an authorized limit. The term "tamaño" in Spanish corresponds to "taille"
#. in French, both indicating the measurement aspect. Similarly, "excede" in
#. Spanish mirrors "dépasse" in French, conveying the concept of surpassing or
#. exceeding a limit.
#: forum/views/views_comment.py:26 forum/views/views_comment.py:48
#: forum/views/views_post.py:71 forum/views/views_post.py:114
msgid "The size of the message exceeds the authorised limit."
msgstr "La tamaño del mensaje excede la cantidad autorizada."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning and
#. tone of the original English sentence. The phrase "Can't delete" is
#. translated as "Imposible de borrar," which maintains the sense of being
#. unable to perform an action. Similarly, "the first message of a thread"
#. becomes "el primer mensaje de una discusión." The French translation
#. "Impossible de supprimer le premier message d'une discussion!" provides
#. clarity that it's referring to deleting a message within a conversation or
#. thread context.
#: forum/views/views_post.py:174
msgid "Can't delete the first message of a thread!"
msgstr "Imposible de borrar el primer mensaje de una discusión!"
