#. Explanation: The English word "content" can have multiple meanings,
#. including the noun referring to the substance or material of something. In
#. this context, the French translation "Contenu" is used, which also refers
#. to the content or substance of a thing. This translation choice reflects
#. the meaning conveyed by the French phrase "Contenu", which is consistent
#. with the intended meaning of the English original sentence.
#: forum/models.py:13
msgid "Content"
msgstr "Conteúdo"

#. Explanation: The English word "Title" and the French word "Titre" both
#. refer to a name or heading, often used in academic, literary, or
#. professional contexts. In Portuguese, the translation is also "Título".
#: forum/models.py:28
msgid "Title"
msgstr "Título"

#. Explanation: The English word "posts" can refer to a blog post or a social
#. media update, while the French translation "discussions" implies a more
#. formal and structured conversation. In this case, the Portuguese
#. translation "postagens" maintains the general meaning of the original
#. English term, which is often used in informal contexts to refer to written
#. content shared on platforms like blogs or social media.
#: forum/models.py:34
msgid "posts"
msgstr "postagens"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a question about how or in what way something was done.
#. The English word "Comment" is often used to ask for explanations or
#. comments, and its direct translation into Portuguese is "Como".
#: forum/models.py:51
msgid "Comment"
msgstr "Como"

#. Explanation: The English word "comments" and the French word "commentaires"
#. both refer to written remarks or observations, so the Portuguese
#. translation "Comentários" is a direct equivalent.
#: forum/models.py:54
msgid "comments"
msgstr "Comentários"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a comment. The English phrase "%(ncomments)s
#. comment" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "number of comments" and
#. "comment". The French translation makes it clear that it is a comment, so
#. the Portuguese version "%s comentário" follows this interpretation.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:5
#, python-format
msgid "%(ncomments)s comment"
msgid_plural "%(ncomments)s comments"
msgstr[0] "%(ncomments)s comentário"
msgstr[1] "%(ncomments)s comentários"

#. Explanation: This translation reflects the meaning of the French phrase,
#. which is to modify or change something. The English word "Edit" can also
#. refer to a process of reviewing and revising written content, but in this
#. context, both translations convey the idea of modification.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:33
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:45
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:91
msgid "Edit"
msgstr "Editar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Delete" can have different meanings
#. depending on the context, such as deleting a file or deleting an account.
#. However, in general, it means to remove or get rid of something. The
#. Portuguese translation "Apagar" is more neutral and can be used in various
#. contexts, including removing files, accounts, or even deleting a task.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:37
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:48
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:95
msgid "Delete"
msgstr "Apagar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Update" can have different meanings, such as
#. to make something newer or fresher, or to inform someone of a change. In
#. this context, the Portuguese translation "Atualizar" is more literal and
#. suggests updating or modifying something, which aligns with the French
#. translation "Mettre à jour".
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:50
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:109
msgid "Update"
msgstr "Atualizar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Cancel" can have different meanings, such as
#. to stop or to void an action. However, in the context of the French
#. translation "Annuler", which implies to cancel or void something, the
#. Portuguese translation "Cancelar" follows this interpretation.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:53
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:78
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:112
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form_include.html:21
msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Cancelar"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Add comment" is a common idiomatic
#. expression that means to add a comment or remark. In Portuguese, the
#. translation "Adicionar comentário" maintains this meaning and uses the word
#. "comentário", which refers to an added comment or remark.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:69
msgid "Add comment"
msgstr "Adicionar comentário"

#. Explanation: The English word "Add" can be translated to Portuguese as
#. "Adicionar", which is a more formal and common way of expressing the idea
#. of adding something.
#: forum/templates/forum/comment_list.html:77
msgid "Add"
msgstr "Adicionar"

#. Explanation: The English word "post" can refer to a written article or a
#. message sent through social media, while the French translation
#. "discussion" implies a conversation or exchange of ideas. In this case, the
#. Portuguese translation "artigo" is more literal and refers specifically to
#. an article or post, without implying a discussion.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:7
msgid "Post"
msgstr "Artigo"

#. Explanation: The placeholder "%(nreplies)s" is kept in the same location as
#. in the original English and French sentences, and the Portuguese
#. translation "resposta" reflects the meaning of the French phrase.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:11
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:34
#, python-format
msgid "%(nreplies)s answer"
msgid_plural "%(nreplies)s answers"
msgstr[0] "%(nreplies)s resposta"
msgstr[1] "%(nreplies)s responde"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a lack of response. The English phrase "No answer"
#. can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "no response" and "no reply". The
#. French translation makes it clear that it is a complete absence of
#. response, so the Portuguese version "Não há resposta" follows this
#. interpretation.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:17
msgid "No answer"
msgstr "Não há resposta"

#. Explanation: The French translation "Ta réponse" is a colloquial and
#. informal way of saying "Your answer". In Portuguese, the formal way to say
#. "Your answer" would be "sua resposta". Since the French translation uses
#. the informal form, the Portuguese translation should also use the informal
#. form.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:130
msgid "Your answer"
msgstr "sua resposta"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Delete post" can be ambiguous, as it could
#. refer to deleting a specific post or the entire post content. However, in
#. this context, where the French translation is "Supprimer la conversation",
#. it seems that the intention is to delete a post or a message within a
#. conversation. Therefore, the Portuguese translation "Apagar publicação"
#. follows this interpretation, suggesting the deletion of a published
#. content.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:133
msgid "Delete post"
msgstr "Apagar publicação"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which asks if the user is sure to delete a specific post and its
#. associated comments and replies. The English sentence uses a placeholder
#. "%(post)s" for the post name, while the French translation includes the
#. same placeholder. The Portuguese version maintains this placeholder in the
#. same location, ensuring that the original context is preserved.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_detail.html:134
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Are you sure you want to delete \"%(post)s\" and all associated replies and "
"comments?"
msgstr ""
"Você está seguro de querer apagar '%(post)s' e todos os comentários e "
"respostas relacionados?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation of the English phrase.
#. The word "Edit" in English means to make changes or modifications, and
#. "Post" refers to an article or a publication. In this context, the
#. translation "Editar Post" accurately conveys the idea of making changes to
#. a post.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:8
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:16
msgid "Edit Post"
msgstr "Editar Post"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates creating a new topic or discussion. The English
#. phrase "Create Post" is more specific to social media platforms and blogs,
#. where posts are created, but in other contexts, it can also mean creating a
#. new topic or discussion.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:10
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form.html:18
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:9
msgid "Create Post"
msgstr "Criar post"

#. Explanation: This translation reflects the meaning of the French phrase,
#. which is a direct and literal translation of the English word "Send". The
#. verb "Enviar" in Portuguese means to transmit or deliver something.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_form_include.html:17
msgid "Send"
msgstr "Enviar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that it refers to recent posts or updates. The
#. English phrase "Latest Posts" is commonly used in blogs and online
#. communities to indicate new content, so the Portuguese version "Últimas
#. publicações" follows this interpretation.
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:3
#: forum/templates/forum/post_list.html:8
msgid "Latest Posts"
msgstr "Últimas publicações"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the message size is exceeding the authorized
#. limit. The English phrase uses the word "exceeds", which can be ambiguous
#. in this context, whereas the French and Portuguese translations use the
#. verb "dépasser" to convey the same idea.
#: forum/views/views_comment.py:26 forum/views/views_comment.py:48
#: forum/views/views_post.py:71 forum/views/views_post.py:114
msgid "The size of the message exceeds the authorised limit."
msgstr "O tamanho do mensagem ultrapassa o limite autorizado."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that it is not possible to delete the first message
#. in a conversation. The English phrase and its French equivalent convey a
#. sense of impossibility or frustration, so the Portuguese version maintains
#. this tone.
#: forum/views/views_post.py:174
msgid "Can't delete the first message of a thread!"
msgstr "Não é possível apagar o primeiro mensagem de uma thread!"
