"als Galerien angelegt und die Fotos in diesen Ordnern werden zu den Galerien "
"hinzugefügt. Alle Fotos müssen in Ordnern sein."

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the photo belongs to a gallery.  The
#. English phrase "A photo must belong to a gallery" can be ambiguous as it
#. could mean that the photo is part of a collection or exhibit in a gallery.
#. The French translation clarifies this by using "une photographie appartient
#. à une galerie," making it clear that the photo is a part of a gallery's
#. collection.
#: models.py:25 models.py:74
msgid "A photo must belong to a gallery."
msgstr "Eine Fotografie gehört einer Galerie an."

#. Explanation: The English word "Photo" is a direct translation of the French
#. word "Photo".  The meaning and context are clear, so no further explanation
#. is needed.

#. Explanation: The English word "Date" is a common term for a specific day or
#. time.  The French word "Date" directly translates this meaning, and it's
#. the most accurate and appropriate choice in this context.
#: models.py:53
msgid "Date"
msgstr "Datum"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately captures the meaning of the
#. English sentence and French translation. It uses the appropriate word order
#. and grammatical structure to convey the intended message.  The use of
#. "Klicken Sie" (click) is a direct equivalent of "Cliquez" in French.
#: models.py:53

msgstr "Klicken Sie auf den Monat oder das Jahr, um sie schnell zu ändern"

#. Explanation:  The English phrase "Cover Photo" is a general term for the

#. translation, "Photo de couverture," refers to the same concept.
#: models.py:117
msgid "Cover Photo"
msgstr "Titelbild"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Parent gallery" is ambiguous as it could
#. refer to a parent's photo album or a gallery that displays artwork from
#. parents.  The French translation "Galerie parente" clarifies the meaning by
#. explicitly stating that it refers to a family-related gallery, which aligns
#. with the context of the original sentence.
#: models.py:120
msgid "Parent gallery"
msgstr "Eltern Galerie"

#. Explanation: The English word "galleries" is a plural noun referring to
#. rooms or spaces where art, photographs, or other objects are displayed.
#. The French word "galeries" also refers to these spaces but can be used in a
#. more general sense, including museums and exhibition halls.
#: models.py:125
msgid "galleries"
msgstr "Galerien"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Une galerie ne peut être son propre
#. parent !", is a direct and clear translation of the English sentence. It
#. accurately conveys the meaning that a gallery cannot be its own parent.
#. The German translation uses the same structure as the French translation to
#. maintain consistency with the original text's tone and meaning.
#: models.py:144
msgid "A gallery can't be its own parent!"
msgstr "Eine Galerie kann nicht ihre eigene Mutter sein!"

#. **Explanation:**  The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, while maintaining consistency with the placeholder
#. format. The use of "eine weitere" and "mit dem gleichen Namen" ensures that
#. the sentence conveys the same information as the original text.
#: models.py:152
#, python-format
msgid "Another sub gallery of %(parent)s with the same name already exists"
msgstr ""
"Eine weitere Untergalerie von %(parent)s mit dem gleichen Namen existiert "
"bereits"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately captures the meaning of the
#. French phrase. It uses the correct grammatical structure and terminology to
#. convey that there is already an existing gallery with the same name in the
#. context of a "root gallery".  The use of "eine weitere" (another) and "mit
#. dem gleichen Namen" (with the same name) clearly indicates the existence of
#. another gallery with the same name.
#: models.py:155
msgid "Another root gallery with the same name already exists"
msgstr "Eine andere Stammgalerie mit demselben Namen existiert bereits"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Bulk Upload Photos" translates to
#. "Télécharger des photos en masse" in French.  The German translation
#. accurately captures the meaning of both phrases, conveying the idea of
#. uploading a large number of photos.
#: templates/galleries/bulk_upload.html:3
#: templates/galleries/bulk_upload.html:6
msgid "Bulk Upload Photos"
msgstr "Ladung von Fotos in Massen"

#. Explanation:  The English word "upload" is generally understood to mean the
#. act of transferring data or files from a computer to a server. The French
#. word "télécharger" means "to download," which is often used in the context
#. of uploading. Therefore, "Laden" is a suitable translation for "Upload."
#: templates/galleries/bulk_upload.html:13
msgid "Upload"
msgstr "Laden"

#. Explanation: The word "galeries" is the plural form of the French word for
#. "gallery," which refers to a room or area where art, artifacts, or other
#. objects are displayed.  The English word "galleries" is also used in this
#. context.
#: templates/galleries/galleries_tree.html:3
#: templates/galleries/galleries_tree.html:5
msgid "Galleries"
msgstr "Galerien"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "No galleries found" is translated directly
#. into German as "Keine Galerien gefunden".  The French translation, "Aucune
#. galerie trouvée," was provided for context. It's important to note that the
#. meaning of the sentence remains consistent in both languages.
#: templates/galleries/galleries_tree.html:7
msgid "No galleries found"
msgstr "Keine Galerien gefunden"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Supprimer une Galerie," is a direct
#. and clear translation of the English phrase "Delete gallery."  It
#. accurately conveys the meaning of removing or deleting the gallery.
#. Let me know if you have any other sentences you'd like me to translate!
#: templates/galleries/gallery_confirm_delete.html:6
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:59
msgid "Delete gallery"
msgstr "Löschen Sie die Galerie"

#. **Explanation:** The French translation accurately conveys the meaning of
#. the English sentence.  The German translation maintains the same structure
#. and phrasing as the French translation to ensure consistency in meaning and
#. tone.  It also uses appropriate grammatical structures and punctuation for
#. a natural-sounding German translation.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_confirm_delete.html:10
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Are you sure you want to delete \"%(object)s\" and all photos and sub "
"galleries it contains?"
msgstr ""
"Sind Sie sicher, dass Sie \"%(object)s\" löschen und alle Fotos und "
"Untergalerien, die es enthält, wollen?"

#. Explanation:  The English word "Confirm" is a direct synonym for the French
#. word "Confirmer". Both words mean to verify or agree with something. The
#. German translation, "Bestätigen," accurately captures this meaning and
#. reflects the context of the user's request.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_confirm_delete.html:17
#: templates/galleries/photo_confirm_delete.html:17
msgid "Confirm"
msgstr "Bestätigen"

#. Explanation:  Both "Cancel" and "Annuler" mean to cancel or stop something.
#. While "Cancel" is a more general term, "Annuler" carries a stronger
#. connotation of formally stopping an ongoing process. In the context of your
#. request, both terms are accurate, but "Abbrechen" provides a more nuanced
#. translation that captures the specific meaning of the English phrase in
#. German.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_confirm_delete.html:21
#: templates/galleries/photo_confirm_delete.html:21
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:29
msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Abbrechen"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Show Gallery" is translated directly into
#. German as "Zeige Galerie". This accurately reflects the meaning of both
#. phrases.  The French translation, "Afficher la Galerie," is a more literal
#. translation that emphasizes the action of displaying the gallery.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:3
msgid "Show Gallery"
msgstr "Zeige Galerie"

#. Explanation:  The English phrase "Children galleries" is a bit ambiguous.
#. It could refer to spaces specifically designed for children, like play
#. areas or art museums with child-friendly exhibits. The French translation
#. "Sous Galeries" suggests that these are galleries located within larger
#. spaces, perhaps in a shopping mall or a museum complex.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:20
msgid "Children galleries"
msgstr "Kindergalerien"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates a return to a specific location or entity.
#. The use of "Zurück zu" and "%(gname)s" maintains the original sentence's
#. structure and conveys the intended meaning in German.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:38
#: templates/galleries/photo_detail.html:23
#, python-format
msgid "Back to %(gname)s"
msgstr "Zurück zu %(gname)s"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Back to galleries list" is translated into
#. German as "Zurück zur Galerie-Liste". This translates the meaning of the
#. original sentence, which refers to returning to a list of galleries.  The
#. French translation "Retour à la liste des gasleries" is used for context
#. and helps clarify the meaning of the English phrase.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:43
msgid "Back to galleries list"
msgstr "Zurück zur Galerie-Liste"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Add Photo" is directly translated to
#. "Ajouter une Photo" in French.  The German translation, "Foto hinzufügen,"
#. accurately conveys the meaning of adding a photo.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:48
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:7
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:20
msgid "Add Photo"
msgstr "Foto hinzufügen"

#. and accurate translation of the English phrase "Create Sub Gallery."  It
#. conveys the same meaning in German.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:52
msgid "Create Sub Gallery"
msgstr "Erstellen Sie eine Untergalerie"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Edit Gallery" is translated directly into
#. German as "Galerie bearbeiten". This translates to "Gallery edit" which

#. translation, "Modification d'une Galerie", provides a more detailed and
#. specific description of the action being performed.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:56
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:5
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:17
msgid "Edit Gallery"
msgstr "Galerie bearbeiten"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Create Gallery" is translated into German
#. as "Erstelle Galerie". This translates the meaning of the English phrase to
#. a more literal and direct form in German.  The use of "Erstelle" means
#. "create" or "make", which aligns with the intended meaning of the English
#. phrase.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:7
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:19
msgid "Create Gallery"
msgstr "Erstelle Galerie"

#. Explanation:  Both "Update" and "Mettre à jour" mean the same thing in
#. English and French. The German word "Aktualisieren" is a direct equivalent
#. of the French phrase "Mettre à jour." It accurately captures the meaning of
#. updating something, whether it's software, information, or a document.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:29
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:28
msgid "Update"
msgstr "Aktualisieren"

#. Explanation:  Both "create" and "créer" are verbs that mean to make
#. something new. The German word "Erstellen" is a more direct translation of
#. the English verb "create" in this context. It emphasizes the act of
#. bringing something into existence.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:32
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:31
msgid "Create"
msgstr "Erstellen"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Delete photo" can be ambiguous, as it
#. could refer to deleting a physical photograph or an image on a digital

#. action is to delete a photo from a digital source.
#: templates/galleries/photo_confirm_delete.html:6
#: templates/galleries/photo_detail.html:30
msgid "Delete photo"
msgstr "Löschen Sie die Foto"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase. It uses a formal tone and maintains the original phrasing

#. as it conveys a sense of caution and certainty.
#: templates/galleries/photo_confirm_delete.html:10
#, python-format
msgid "Are you sure you want to delete \"%(object)s\"?"

#. in German.
#: templates/galleries/photo_detail.html:27
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:5
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:18
msgid "Edit Photo"
msgstr "Bearbeite die Foto"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. English phrase, capturing both the action of "creating" and the addition of
#. a new element.  The use of "Erstelle" (create) and "füge" (add) conveys the
#. intended meaning in a clear and concise manner.
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:32
msgid "Create and add another one"
msgstr "Erstelle und füge eine weitere hinzu"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Galerie supprimée avec tout son
#. contenu," indicates that the gallery was completely removed.  The German
#. translation accurately reflects this meaning by using the verb "gelöscht"
#. (deleted) and specifying that it included all of its content.
#: tests/tests_gallery.py:223 views/views_gallery.py:61
msgid "Gallery deleted"
msgstr "Die Galerie wurde gelöscht"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Photo deleted" is translated directly into
#. German as "Foto gelöscht". This accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. original text.  The word "Foto" in German means "photo," and "gelöscht"
#. means "deleted."
#: tests/tests_photo.py:120 views/views_photo.py:98
msgid "Photo deleted"
msgstr "Foto gelöscht"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English and French sentences. It uses the correct word order and
#. grammatical structure to translate the sentence's meaning while preserving
#. the original tone and nuance.  The use of "Fotos" instead of "Photos" is a
#. stylistic choice, but it maintains the intended meaning.
#: views/views_bulk.py:53
msgid "Photos can't be at the root of the zip file."
msgstr "Fotos können nicht an der Wurzel des Zip-Datei sein."

#. "Gefundener Pfadverschiebung-Versuch, '..' ist nicht in den Paketen
#. erlaubt"
#. ```
#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase. It translates "Tentative de traversée de chemin détectée" to
#. "Gefundener Pfadverschiebung-Versuch" and "n'est pas autorisé dans les
#. chemins à l'intérieur du fichier zip" to " '..' ist nicht in den Paketen
#. erlaubt".
#: views/views_bulk.py:71
msgid ""
"Detected path traversal attempt, '..' is not allowed in paths inside the zip"
" file"
msgstr ""
"Erkannter Pfadüberquerungsversuch, '..' ist in Pfaden innerhalb der "
"Zip-Datei nicht erlaubt"

#. Explanation: The English sentence is about importing something from a
#. specific directory within a ZIP file.  The French translation, while
#. accurate in meaning, could be improved for clarity and consistency with the
#. German structure. "Aus dem Zip-Dateiverzeichnis" means "from the ZIP file
#. directory," which is more direct than "Importé du répertoire {path} du
#. fichier zip."
#: views/views_bulk.py:80
#, python-brace-format
msgid "Imported from zipfile directory {path}"
msgstr "Aus dem {path} Zip-Dateiverzeichnis importiert"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the file was imported from a zip file
#. directory.  The use of "aus dem Zip-Dateiverzeichnis" means "from the zip
#. file directory", and "importiert" means "imported".
#: views/views_bulk.py:108
#, python-brace-format
msgid "Imported from zipfile directory {filename}"
msgstr "Aus dem {filename} Zip-Dateiverzeichnis importiert"

#. Explanation: The German translation attempts to capture the meaning of the
#. English sentence, which is that an attempt to import a photo failed.  The
#. phrase "Unbekannte Import-Foto" translates to "Unknown import photo," and
#. "Ignoriert" means "ignored."
#: views/views_bulk.py:177
#, python-brace-format
msgid "Unable to import photo '{path}', it was ignored"
msgstr "Unbekannte Import-Foto '{path}' - Ignoriert"

#. **Explanation:**  The translation aims to capture the meaning of the
#. original sentence while maintaining its technical context. Here's a
#. breakdown:
#. * **"ZIP-Datei hochgeladen"**: This accurately translates "Zip file
#. uploaded."
#. * **"{lg} Galerien"**: The placeholder
#. `{lg}` is replaced with the number of galleries in the
#. object `self.galleries`.
#. * **"{nbp} Fotos"**: The placeholder `{nbp}` represents
#. the number of photos created.
#. The translation uses a more formal and technical tone appropriate for the
#. context, while still conveying the meaning accurately.

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that either a photo ID or a gallery ID is
#. missing.  The use of "Fehlender" means "missing" and "Foto-ID" and
#. "Galerie-ID" are translated directly from the French terms.
#: views/views_photo.py:30
msgid "Missing either photo id or gallery id"
msgstr "Fehlender Foto-ID oder Galerie-ID"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English and French sentences. It uses the correct word order and

#. context.
#: views/views_photo.py:50

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
