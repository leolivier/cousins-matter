#. Explanation: The French translation "Fichier ZIP" is used to refer to a
#. compressed archive, while the English phrase "Zip file" can be more
#. general. In Portuguese, we use "arquivo ZIP" to maintain consistency with
#. the French translation and indicate that it's a compressed archive.
#: forms.py:15
msgid "Zip file"
msgstr "Arquivo ZIP"

#. Explanation: This translation reflects the meaning of the French phrase,
#. which indicates that all folders will be created as galleries and photos
#. added to these galleries. The original English sentence is a bit ambiguous,
#. but the French translation makes it clear that the goal is to organize
#. photos into galleries within folders.
#: forms.py:16
msgid ""
"The zip file containing the photos to upload. All folders will be created as"
" galleries and photos in these folders added to the galleries. All photos "
"must be in folders."
msgstr ""
"O arquivo zip que contém as fotos para subir. Todas as pastas serão criadas "
"como galerias e as fotos dessas pastas serão adicionadas às galerias. Todas "
"as fotos devem estar em pastas."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a photo should be part of a collection or
#. exhibition. The English sentence is clear and direct, while the French
#. translation adds a nuance by using the word "doit", which implies a sense
#. of obligation or necessity.
#: models.py:25 models.py:74
msgid "A photo must belong to a gallery."
msgstr "Uma foto deve pertencer a uma galeria."

#. Explanation: The English and French translations are identical, so the
#. Portuguese translation is also a direct copy.
#: models.py:48 templates/galleries/photo_detail.html:3
msgid "Photo"
msgstr "Foto"

#. Explanation: The English word "Name" and the French word "Nom" have a
#. direct equivalent in Portuguese, which is also "Nome".
#: models.py:50 models.py:115
msgid "Name"
msgstr "Nome"

#. Explanation: The English and French translations are identical, so the
#. Portuguese translation is also a direct copy of the original.
#: models.py:51 models.py:116
msgid "Description"
msgstr "Descrição"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Date" can refer to a specific point in
#. time, a calendar date, or even a social engagement. However, the French
#. translation "Date" is likely referring to the latter meaning, as it is
#. commonly used in the context of social events and appointments. Therefore,
#. the Portuguese translation "Data" follows this interpretation, suggesting a
#. scheduled event or appointment.
#: models.py:53
msgid "Date"
msgstr "Data"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that clicking on the month name or year will allow
#. for quick changes. The original English sentence is clear and concise, but
#. the French translation adds a touch of elegance with the use of "modifier
#. rapidement", which conveys the same idea in a more formal tone.
#: models.py:53
msgid "Click on the month name or the year to change them quickly"
msgstr "Clique em nome do mês ou do ano para mudá-los rapidamente"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a common term used in digital media and social networks to
#. refer to the main image displayed on a user's profile or page. The English
#. phrase "Cover Photo" is also widely used in this context, making the
#. Portuguese version "Capa" a suitable equivalent.
#: models.py:117
msgid "Cover Photo"
msgstr "Capa"

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same meaning and
#. structure as the French original, using the word "galera" to refer to a
#. collection or group of people (in this case, parents), and adding the
#. definite article "de" before it. This is consistent with the French phrase
#. "Galerie parente", which uses the word "galerie" to describe a collection
#. of relatives.
#: models.py:120
msgid "Parent gallery"
msgstr "Galera de pais"

#. Explanation: The French translation "galeries" is used to refer to
#. exhibition spaces or rooms, whereas the English word "galleries" can also
#. refer to a collection of artworks. In this case, the Portuguese translation
#. "Galérias" follows the meaning of the French phrase, which suggests a space
#. for exhibiting art.
#: models.py:125
msgid "galleries"
msgstr "Galérias"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which emphasizes that a gallery cannot have itself as its parent.
#. The exclamation mark at the end is preserved to maintain the same tone and
#. emphasis as in the original English sentence.
#: models.py:144
msgid "A gallery can't be its own parent!"
msgstr "Uma galeria não pode ser sua própria mãe!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that there is already another gallery with the same
#. name and parent. The English sentence uses a placeholder for the parent
#. name, which is preserved in the Portuguese translation to maintain
#. consistency with the original context.
#: models.py:152
#, python-format
msgid "Another sub gallery of %(parent)s with the same name already exists"
msgstr "Outra subgaleria de %(parent)s com o mesmo nome já existe"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that there is another gallery with the same name
#. already existing. The English sentence can be ambiguous, but the French
#. translation makes it clear that it's about a new instance of a gallery with
#. the same name, so the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: models.py:155
msgid "Another root gallery with the same name already exists"
msgstr "Outra galeria de raiz com o mesmo nome já existe"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Bulk Upload Photos" can be interpreted as
#. either "uploading a large quantity of photos" or "bulk uploading photos".
#. The French translation "Télécharger des photos en masse" makes it clear
#. that the action is to download or upload a large quantity of photos, which
#. is consistent with the meaning of the original English phrase.
#: templates/galleries/bulk_upload.html:3
#: templates/galleries/bulk_upload.html:6
msgid "Bulk Upload Photos"
msgstr "Carregar Fotos em Bulk"

#. Explanation: The English word "Upload" and the French word "Télécharger"
#. both refer to the act of sending or transferring data from one place to
#. another. In Portuguese, this action is commonly referred to as "carregar",
#. which means "to load" or "to upload".
#: templates/galleries/bulk_upload.html:13
msgid "Upload"
msgstr "Carregar"

#. Explanation: The French and Portuguese translations are identical, as the
#. word "galleries" is a direct loan from English to both languages.
#: templates/galleries/galleries_tree.html:3
#: templates/galleries/galleries_tree.html:5
msgid "Galleries"
msgstr "Galérias"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that no galleries were found. The English phrase
#. "No galleries found" is a common way to express this idea in an informal
#. context, while the French phrase "Aucune galerie trouvée" is more formal
#. and precise.
#: templates/galleries/galleries_tree.html:7
msgid "No galleries found"
msgstr "Não foram encontradas galerias"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Delete gallery" can be interpreted as
#. deleting a physical gallery, but the French translation "Supprimer une
#. Galerie" makes it clear that it's about removing or deleting a digital
#. gallery. In Portuguese, we use "apagar" to indicate removal or deletion,
#. and "galeria" is used to refer to a collection of images or files, making
#. the translation consistent with the French original.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_confirm_delete.html:6
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:59
msgid "Delete gallery"
msgstr "Apagar galeria"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a confirmation question about deleting an object and its
#. associated content. The English sentence uses a placeholder for the object
#. name, while the French translation includes it in the question. The
#. Portuguese version maintains this format to ensure clarity and consistency.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_confirm_delete.html:10
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Are you sure you want to delete \"%(object)s\" and all photos and sub "
"galleries it contains?"
msgstr ""
"Você está seguro de querer apagar '%(object)s' e todas as fotos e "
"subgalerias que ela contém?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is to verify or validate something. The English word
#. "Confirm" also carries this same meaning, so the Portuguese version
#. "Confirmar" follows this interpretation.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_confirm_delete.html:17
#: templates/galleries/photo_confirm_delete.html:17
msgid "Confirm"
msgstr "Confirmar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Cancel" can have different meanings, such as
#. to stop or to void an action. However, in the context of the French
#. translation "Annuler", it seems that the intended meaning is to cancel or
#. void something, which is a common usage in both languages.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_confirm_delete.html:21
#: templates/galleries/photo_confirm_delete.html:21
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:29
msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Cancelar"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Show Gallery" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, but the most common meaning is to display or exhibit a
#. collection of images. The French translation "Afficher la Galerie" makes it
#. clear that the action is to show or display the gallery, which aligns with
#. this interpretation.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:3
msgid "Show Gallery"
msgstr "Mostrar Galeria"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Children galleries" can be ambiguous, as
#. it could refer to either a collection of artworks or exhibitions related to
#. children. However, the context provided by the French translation "Sous-
#. Galeries", which implies a sub-level or section within a larger gallery,
#. suggests that the Portuguese translation should also imply a sub-level or
#. section, hence "Galérias infantis".
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:20
msgid "Children galleries"
msgstr "Galérias infantis"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Back to %s" is a common idiomatic
#. expression meaning returning to something or someone. In this context, the
#. placeholder "%(gname)s" refers to the name of the person or entity being
#. returned to. The French translation maintains the same idiomatic expression
#. and placeholder, indicating that the speaker is returning to the specified
#. person or entity.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:38
#: templates/galleries/photo_detail.html:23
#, python-format
msgid "Back to %(gname)s"
msgstr "%s"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates returning to the gallery list. The English phrase
#. "Back to galleries list" suggests going back to the main list of galleries,
#. while the French and Portuguese translations maintain the same nuance.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:43
msgid "Back to galleries list"
msgstr "Voltando para a lista de galerias"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Add Photo" can be interpreted in different
#. ways, but the French translation "Ajouter une Photo" makes it clear that
#. the action is to add a photo. In Portuguese, we use the verb "adicionar"
#. which means to add or include, and the noun "foto" which refers
#. specifically to a photograph.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:48
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:7
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:20
msgid "Add Photo"
msgstr "Adicionar Foto"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation. The English phrase
#. "Create Sub Gallery" implies creating a new gallery that is subordinate to
#. another gallery, while the French phrase "Créer une Sous-Galerie" also
#. conveys this idea.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:52
msgid "Create Sub Gallery"
msgstr "Criar uma Galeria Subsidiária"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a modification or editing of a gallery. The English
#. phrase "Edit Gallery" is straightforward and implies making changes to the
#. gallery, so the Portuguese version "Edição de Galeria" follows this
#. interpretation.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_detail.html:56
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:5
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:17
msgid "Edit Gallery"
msgstr "Edição de Galeria"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a creation or establishment of a gallery. The
#. English phrase "Create Gallery" is straightforward and implies the act of
#. creating a new gallery, so the Portuguese version "Criar Galeria" follows
#. this interpretation.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:7
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:19
msgid "Create Gallery"
msgstr "Criar Galeria"

#. Explanation: The English word "Update" can have different meanings, such as
#. to make something newer or more recent. In this context, the Portuguese
#. translation "Atualizar" is used to convey the idea of updating or modifying
#. something, which aligns with the French translation "Mettre à jour".
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:29
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:28
msgid "Update"
msgstr "Atualizar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation of the English word. The
#. verb "create" in English has a similar meaning to the verb "créer" in
#. French, indicating the act of bringing something into existence or making
#. something new.
#: templates/galleries/gallery_form.html:32
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:31
msgid "Create"
msgstr "Crear"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation. The English phrase
#. "Delete photo" can be interpreted in different ways, but the French
#. translation makes it clear that the action is to remove or delete the
#. photo.
#: templates/galleries/photo_confirm_delete.html:6
#: templates/galleries/photo_detail.html:30
msgid "Delete photo"
msgstr "Apagar a foto"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct question about the user's intention to delete an
#. object. The English sentence uses a placeholder for the object name, and
#. the French translation makes it clear that the question is about deleting a
#. specific object.
#: templates/galleries/photo_confirm_delete.html:10
#, python-format
msgid "Are you sure you want to delete \"%(object)s\"?"
msgstr "Você está seguro de querer apagar '%(object)s'?"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "One photo" can be ambiguous, as it could
#. refer to a single photograph or a collection of photos. However, in the
#. context of the French translation "Une photo", which implies a singular
#. object, the Portuguese translation "Uma foto" follows this interpretation,
#. suggesting a single photograph.
#: templates/galleries/photo_counter.html:4
#, python-format
msgid "One photo"
msgid_plural "%(counter)s photos"
msgstr[0] "Uma foto"
msgstr[1] "%s fotos"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that there is no photo. The English phrase "No
#. photo" can be ambiguous, as it can also mean "no picture" or "no image",
#. but in this context, it clearly means "no photo".
#: templates/galleries/photo_counter.html:6
msgid "No photo"
msgstr "Não há foto"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Gallery" can be translated to Portuguese
#. as "galera", which is a more informal and colloquial term for "gallery".
#. This translation choice reflects the meaning of the French phrase, which
#. uses the same term "Galerie" without any variation.
#: templates/galleries/photo_detail.html:13
#, python-format
msgid "Gallery %(gname)s"
msgstr "Galera %(gname)s"

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same meaning and tone
#. as the French original, using the verb "editar" to indicate editing or
#. modifying the photo.
#: templates/galleries/photo_detail.html:27
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:5
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:18
msgid "Edit Photo"
msgstr "Editar a Foto"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates creating something new and adding it to a
#. collection or set. The English phrase "Create and add another one" can be
#. interpreted as either creating something new and then adding another
#. instance of it, or simply creating and adding one more item to an existing
#. collection. The French translation makes it clear that it is about creating
#. something new and then adding another one, so the Portuguese version
#. follows this interpretation.
#: templates/galleries/photo_form.html:32
msgid "Create and add another one"
msgstr "Criar e adicionar outro"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the gallery was completely removed or deleted.
#. The English phrase "Gallery deleted" can be ambiguous, as it may only refer
#. to the removal of a specific item or content from the gallery, rather than
#. the entire gallery itself. The French translation makes it clear that the
#. gallery was entirely removed, so the Portuguese version "Galera excluída"
#. follows this interpretation.
#: tests/tests_gallery.py:223 views/views_gallery.py:61
msgid "Gallery deleted"
msgstr "Galera excluída"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Photo deleted" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, but the context of the French translation "Photo supprimée"
#. suggests that it means the photo was removed or erased. In Portuguese, this
#. is accurately conveyed by "Foto excluída", which implies a deletion or
#. removal of the photo.
#: tests/tests_photo.py:120 views/views_photo.py:98
msgid "Photo deleted"
msgstr "Foto excluída"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the root of a zip file cannot contain photos.
#. The English sentence is clear about excluding photos from the root, and the
#. Portuguese version maintains this clarity.
#: views/views_bulk.py:53
msgid "Photos can't be at the root of the zip file."
msgstr "As fotos não podem estar na raiz do arquivo zip."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a path traversal attempt has been detected and
#. that the ".." character is not allowed in paths inside the zip file. The
#. English sentence can be ambiguous, as it could refer to other types of
#. files or situations, but the context provided by the French translation
#. makes it clear that this is specifically related to zip files.
#: views/views_bulk.py:71
msgid ""
"Detected path traversal attempt, '..' is not allowed in paths inside the zip"
" file"
msgstr ""
"Traversão de caminho detectada, '..' não é permitida em caminhos dentro do "
"arquivo zip"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the file was imported from a ZIP archive. The
#. English phrase "Imported from zipfile directory {path}" suggests that the
#. path to the ZIP archive is being provided, and this is preserved in the
#. Portuguese translation.
#: views/views_bulk.py:80
#, python-brace-format
msgid "Imported from zipfile directory {path}"
msgstr "Importado de diretório do arquivo zip {path}"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the file was imported from a ZIP archive. The
#. English phrase "Imported from zipfile directory {filename}" suggests that
#. the file is being imported from a specific directory within a ZIP archive,
#. while the French translation makes it clear that it is a ZIP archive.
#: views/views_bulk.py:108
#, python-brace-format
msgid "Imported from zipfile directory {filename}"
msgstr "Importado de diretório do arquivo {filename}"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the photo could not be imported and was
#. therefore ignored. The English phrase "Unable to import photo '{path}', it
#. was ignored" can be ambiguous, as it uses the word "was" instead of "was
#. ignored", making it clear that the action of ignoring happened after the
#. attempt to import the photo.
#: views/views_bulk.py:177
#, python-brace-format
msgid "Unable to import photo '{path}', it was ignored"
msgstr "Impossível importar a foto '{path}' , ela foi ignorada"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the zip file was uploaded and some galleries
#. were created, while some photos were also created. The placeholders `{lg}`
#. and `{nbp}` are kept in the same place as in the original sentence to
#. maintain consistency with the contextual translation.
#: views/views_bulk.py:191
msgid "Zip file uploaded: {lg} galleries and {nbp} photos created"
msgstr "Arquivo zip carregado: {lg} galerias e {nbp} fotos criadas"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that one of the photo or gallery identifiers is
#. missing. The English sentence "Missing either photo id or gallery id" can
#. be ambiguous, as it uses the word "either", which could imply an exclusive
#. choice between the two options. The French translation makes it clear that
#. only one identifier is required to be present, so the Portuguese version
#. "Um identificador de foto ou de galeria está faltando." follows this
#. interpretation.
#: views/views_photo.py:30
msgid "Missing either photo id or gallery id"
msgstr "Um identificador de foto ou de galeria está faltando."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a photo was not found on a specific page. The
#. English sentence is clear and direct, while the French translation uses
#. more formal language to convey the same idea. In Portuguese, "naquela
#. página" is used to indicate a specific webpage or page number, making the
#. translation consistent with the original meaning.
#: views/views_photo.py:50
msgid "Photo not found on that page"
msgstr "Foto não encontrada naquela página"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Photo created" can be ambiguous, as it can
#. mean both "taking a photo" and "creating an image". However, the context of
#. the French translation "Photo créée" suggests that the action is more
#. related to creating or producing an image, which aligns with the Portuguese
#. translation "Foto criada".
#: views/views_photo.py:71
msgid "Photo created"
msgstr "Foto criada"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a specific error occurred when creating the photo
#. and provides guidance on how to resolve the issue by converting the format
#. before retrying the upload process.
#: views/views_photo.py:78
msgid ""
"Error when creating this photo. Try to convert it in another format before "
"retrying to upload it."
msgstr ""
"Erro ao criar essa foto. Tente converter para outro formato antes de tentar "
"carregar novamente."
