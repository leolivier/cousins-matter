#. Explanation:  The English word "Members" is directly translated to the
#. German word "Mitglieder" in this context. This word accurately reflects the
#. meaning of "Members" in a general sense, referring to people who belong to
#. a group or organization.
#: apps.py:8

#. the email received. This clarification helps to ensure accurate and
#. consistent translation.
#: forms.py:109
msgid "Name of the invited person (will appear in the received email)"
msgstr "Name desInvitees (wird im erhaltenen E-Mail angezeigt)"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Email to send invitation" is a clear

#. of "E-Mail" for email and "l'invitation" for the invitation is consistent
#. with the context.
#: forms.py:110
msgid "Email to send invitation"
msgstr "E-Mail zur Einladung"

#. Explanation:  The English phrase "Your name" is directly translated to "Ton
#. nom" in French. The German word for "name" is "Name".
#. Let me know if you have any other sentences you'd like me to translate!
#: forms.py:114

msgstr "Ihr Name"

#. Explanation: The French translation is clear and concise.  The German
#. translation maintains a similar structure to the French version, using
#. "E-Mail" for the email type and "in der du den Link erhältst" to convey the
#. meaning of receiving the link.
#: forms.py:115
msgid "Email where you will receive the link"
msgstr "E-Mail, in der du den Link erhältst"

#. Explanation:  The French translation, "Message à l'administrateur," is a
#. clear and concise way to say "Message for the administrator." The German
#. translation maintains this meaning while using appropriate terminology.
#: forms.py:116

#. Explanation: The French translation is a bit ambiguous. It needs to be
#. clarified that the user should click on the image to refresh it if they

#. Sie auf die Bild, um es zu aktualisieren, wenn Sie es nicht lesen können"
#: forms.py:117
msgid "Captcha (click on the image to refresh if you can't read it)"
msgstr ""
"CAPTCHA (klicken Sie auf die Bild, um es zu aktualisieren, wenn Sie es nicht"

msgid "CSV file"
msgstr "CSV-Datei"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the CSV file contains information about
#. members to be imported.  The use of "der" for "the" and "CSV-Datei" for
#. "CSV file" maintains consistency with the original sentence's structure.

msgstr "Der CSV-Datei mit den Mitgliedern zum Importieren."

#: forms.py:137
msgid "Automatically activate imported users"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Le nom d'utilisateur doit être

#: managers.py:14
msgid "The username must be set"
msgstr "Der Benutzername muss gesetzt werden"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. English and French sentences. It uses the appropriate terminology and
#. grammatical structure to convey the same idea as the original text.  The
#. use of "ein Superbenutzer" (a super user) directly translates to
#. "Superuser" in English, while "is_staff=True" is translated into
#. "is_staff=True".
#: managers.py:35

msgstr "Ein Superbenutzer muss is_staff=True sein."

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that a super user must have `is_superuser`

#. can be ambiguous as it could refer to either granting access or setting a
#. specific value for a variable.
#: managers.py:37
msgid "Superuser must have is_superuser=True."
msgstr "Ein Superbenutzer muss is_superuser=True sein."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "number and street" is translated into

msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "address_complementary_info"
msgstr "Adresse_komplementär_Informationen"

#. translation of "city".
#: models.py:20

msgid "city"
msgstr "Stadt"

#. Explanation:  Both "country" and "land" refer to a defined geographical
#. area. While "country" is more common in English, "land" is also used
#. frequently in both languages. In this case, the context of the sentence
#. doesn't require a specific nuance or formality that would warrant using one
#. over the other.
#: models.py:21
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "country"
msgstr "Land"

#. Explanation:  The English word "username" is translated directly into the
#. German word "Benutzername." This accurately reflects the meaning of both

msgid "first_name"
msgstr "Vorname"

msgid "last_name"
msgstr "Letzte Name"

#. that it's additional information.
#: models.py:67
msgid "Complementary info"
msgstr "Komplizierte Informationen"

#. Explanation:  "Zip code" is a common term in English, but it's often used
#. to refer to the postal code of a specific area. In German, "Gebietscode" is

msgid "My hobbies"
msgstr "Meine Hobbys"

#. of information about an address.
#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:3
msgid "Address Detail"
msgstr "Adresse Details"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Complementary Info" is a bit ambiguous and

#: templates/members/address/address_form.html:8
msgid "Edit Address"
msgstr "Bearbeiten Sie Ihre Adresse"

#. Explanation: The English word "submit" has a broad meaning, but in the
#. context of this sentence, it likely refers to submitting something for

#: templates/members/family/family_form.html:17

msgstr "Senden"

#. Explanation:  "Cancel" and "Annuler" both mean the same thing in English

msgid "Verify Email address"
msgstr "Überprüfen Sie die E-Mail-Adresse"

#. the email confirmation process.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:21
msgid "E-mail Confirmation"
msgstr "E-Mail-Bestätigung"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Greetings!" is a general greeting, and the
#. French translation "Salutations!"  is more formal. While both are
#. appropriate for different situations, "Hallo!" is a more casual and direct
#. way to say "greetings." It's a common greeting in German-speaking
#. countries.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:25
msgid "Greetings!"
msgstr "Hallo!"

#. Explanation: The French translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

msgid ""
"You received this mail because you attempted to create an account on our "
"website"
msgstr ""
"Du hast diese E-Mail erhalten, weil du versucht hast, ein Konto auf unserer "
"Website zu erstellen."

#. Explanation: The French translation is a bit ambiguous as it doesn't
#. clearly state the action of clicking on the link.  The German translation
#. clarifies this by explicitly stating "Bitte klicken Sie auf den Link
#. unten".
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:28
#: tests/tests_member.py:335
msgid ""
"Please click on the link below to confirm the email and activate your "
"account."
msgstr ""
"Bitte klicken Sie auf den Link unten, um die E-Mail zu bestätigen und Ihr "
"Konto zu aktivieren."

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Tu nous rejoindras juste après la
#. vérification!", is a bit ambiguous. It suggests that the speaker will join
#. them after the verification process.  The German translation tries to
#. capture this meaning by using the phrase "Du wirst uns nach der Überprüfung
#. bei uns sein!"
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:31
msgid "You'll be joining us right after the verification !"
msgstr "Du wirst uns nach der Überprüfung bei uns sein!"

#. Explanation:  Both "verify" and "vérifier" mean to confirm the truth or
#. accuracy of something. In this context, "überprüfen" is a more direct and
#. idiomatic German equivalent of "verifying". It carries a similar meaning to
#. "verify" in English.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:36
msgid "Verify"
msgstr "Überprüfen"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English and French sentences. It uses the formal "Bitte" to address the
#. recipient politely, while also using "maschinell generiert" to clearly
#. indicate that the email is not a human response.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:39
#: templates/members/email/new_follower.html:22
msgid "Do not reply to this mail, it is machine generated."
msgstr ""
"Bitte antworten Sie nicht an diese E-Mail, sie ist maschinell generiert."

#. Explanation: The French translation is a bit ambiguous as it uses "te suit
#. maintenant" which can be interpreted in two ways.  The German translation
#. aims to clarify the meaning of the sentence by using a more direct and
#. unambiguous phrasing.
#: templates/members/email/new_follower.html:17

msgstr "Einladung für %(invited)s zur Registrierung bei %(site_name)s"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that registration is taking place on a
#. website.  The use of "Anmeldung" (registration) and "Website" (website) in
#. German aligns with the context of the sentence.
#: templates/members/email/registration_invite_email.html:17
#: tests/tests_register.py:39
#, python-format
msgid "Registration to the \"%(site_name)s\" site"
msgstr "Anmeldung auf der Website \"%(site_name)s"

#. Explanation: The provided context and the French translation are ambiguous.
#. The English sentence is a greeting to an individual named "invited". The
#. French translation uses the same structure as the English sentence, but
#. it's important to note that the French translation does not explicitly
#. state who is speaking or what they are doing. Therefore, I have translated
#. the sentence in German using the provided context and French translation.
#: templates/members/email/registration_invite_email.html:22
#, python-format
msgid "Hello %(invited)s, this is %(inviter)s!"
msgstr "Hallo %(invited)s, das ist %(inviter)s!\","

#. Explanation: The English word "Birthday" is a general term for the day of

#: templates/members/members/birthdays.html:3
#: templates/members/members/members.html:11
msgid "Birthdays"
msgstr "Geburtstage"

#. Explanation: The English sentence is about birthdays occurring within a

#. "Geburtdaten" to refer to birthdays.
#: templates/members/members/birthdays_include.html:4
#, python-format

msgstr "Geburtdaten in den nächsten %(ndays)s Tagen"

#, python-format
msgid "turns %(age)s today, happy birthday!"

#. Explanation: The provided English sentence is a bit ambiguous.  The phrase

#. and tone of the original text.

#: tests/tests_birthdays.py:42
#, python-format
msgid "will turn %(age)s tomorrow, happy birthday!"

#. Explanation: The provided English sentence describes a future event where
#. the subject will reach a certain age.  The French translation, "aura
#. %(age)s ans %(birthday)s," accurately reflects this meaning by using the
#. present tense ("aura") and specifying the age and birthday in the context
#. of the sentence.

#: tests/tests_birthdays.py:47
#, python-format

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that there are no birthdays within the next
#. number of days.  The English phrase "No birthdays in next %(ndays)s days"
#. is ambiguous as it can mean either "no birthdays in the next few days" or
#. "no birthdays in the next 10 days". The French translation makes it clear
#. that it is a specific number of days, so the German version "Keine
#. Geburtstage in den nächsten %(ndays)s Tagen" follows this interpretation.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "City filter" is translated directly into

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase. It uses the formal "du" pronoun for a direct address to the

msgstr "Nur Superbenutzer können Mitglieder einladen"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the invitation was sent. The English
#. phrase "Invitation sent to %(email)s" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both
#. "giving a ring" and "making a phone call" colloquially. The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is a phone call, so the German version

#. Explanation: The French translation "CAPTCHA invalide" is a direct and

msgid "You are no longer following %(followed_name)s"
msgstr "Du bist nicht mehr %(followed_name)s"

#. Explanation: The French translation, "Tu suis maintentant
#. %(followed_name)s," is ambiguous. It suggests that the user is now
#. following someone named %(followed_name)s in a way similar to how one
#. follows on social media.  The German translation aims for clarity and
#. accuracy by using the verb "ist jetzt verbunden" which means "is now
#. connected".

#, python-format
msgid "You are now following %(followed_name)s"

#. user. The English phrase "**(Follower_name)** is now following you!" can be
#. ambiguous, as it can mean both "giving a ring" and "making a phone call"

#. call, so the German version "**(Follower_name)** ist jetzt dich folgen!"
#. follows this interpretation.

#. fields are %(all_names)s", which accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French translation.
#. The overall goal was to ensure that the German translation conveys the same
#. information as the original English text, while also maintaining a
#. consistent tone and structure.

msgstr "Du wurdest ausgeloggt"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately captures the meaning of the
