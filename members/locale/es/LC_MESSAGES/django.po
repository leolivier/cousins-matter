#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English term
#. "Members" directly translates to "Membres" in Spanish. There is no need for
#. any interpretation or adjustment, as both terms refer to the same concept
#. of individuals who are part of a group or organization.
#: apps.py:8
msgid "Members"
msgstr "Membres"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French sentence. The placeholders are maintained in their same
#. semantic locations, ensuring that "Name", "of the invited person", and
#. "will appear in the received email" remain as they were in the original
#. English text. The French phrase "Nom de la personne invitée (apparaîtra
#. dans l'e-mail reçu)" is translated to "Nombre del persona invitada
#. (aparecerá en el correo recibido)", which maintains the same structure and
#. meaning, including the future tense indicated by "will appear" in the
#. English text.
#: forms.py:109
msgid "Name of the invited person (will appear in the received email)"
msgstr "Nombre del persona invitada (aparecerá en el correo recibido)"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French phrase. Both English and French sentences are about sending
#. an email that contains or is associated with an invitation. The structure
#. and vocabulary used in both languages maintain a consistent approach to
#. this concept, ensuring clarity and precision in communication.
#: forms.py:110
msgid "Email to send invitation"
msgstr "Correo electrónico al que enviar la invitación"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. "Ton nom," which means "Your name." The placeholder "{name}" in the English
#. sentence is kept as-is, maintaining its original position.
#: forms.py:114
msgid "Your name"
msgstr "Tu nombre"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French phrase. The key elements are maintained, including the use
#. of "où" (where) to indicate the location for receiving the email and "tu
#. recevras le lien" (you will receive the link), which is correctly
#. translated as "recibirás el enlace." The structure and grammar in Spanish
#. closely mirror those in French, ensuring a natural and clear translation.
#: forms.py:115
msgid "Email where you will receive the link"
msgstr "Email donde recibirás el enlace"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates a message directed towards an
#. administrator. The structure and word choice in both languages are
#. consistent, maintaining the formal tone appropriate for communication with
#. an administrative body.
#: forms.py:116
msgid "Message to the administrator"
msgstr "Mensaje al administrador"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which instructs the user to click on an image and
#. refresh it if they cannot read it. The term "Captcha" is left untranslated
#. as placeholders are not allowed in this context.
#: forms.py:117
msgid "Captcha (click on the image to refresh if you can't read it)"
msgstr "Captcha (clicke en la imagen para refrescarla si no la lees bien)"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the term "CSV" (Comma-
#. Separated Values) remains unchanged in Spanish, similar to its French
#. equivalent. The context of a "Fichier CSV" refers to a text file format
#. used for tabular data where values are separated by commas and typically
#. uses semicolons or line breaks to delimit records.
#: forms.py:132
msgid "CSV file"
msgstr "Fichier CSV"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French text. The placeholders in both sentences are maintained as
#. they appear in their original positions, ensuring consistency with the
#. context translations. In this case, "The CSV file containing the members to
#. import" and "Le fichier CSV contenant les membres à importer" have been
#. translated into Spanish as "El archivo CSV que contiene a los miembros para
#. importar." The structure of both sentences is preserved, maintaining the
#. same meaning and intent.
#: forms.py:133
msgid "The CSV file containing the members to import."
msgstr "El archivo CSV que contiene a los miembros para importar."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English phrase. The term "automatically activate" in English is
#. translated as "activar automáticamente," which maintains the same sense and
#. implication of performing an action without any manual intervention or user
#. input, specifically for imported users. The French translation "Activer
#. automatiquement les utilisateurs importés" also uses this exact phrasing,
#. ensuring consistency between all three languages.
#: forms.py:137
msgid "Automatically activate imported users"
msgstr "Activar automáticamente los usuarios importados"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "The username must be set" is ambiguous and
#. could mean either setting the username (making it mandatory) or giving a
#. specific value to the username. Given the French translation, which states
#. that the user should provide ("fuourni") the name of the user ("le nom
#. d'utilisateur"), we can infer that the correct interpretation is "No debe
#. establecer el nombre de usuario," meaning that the username must be
#. provided but not necessarily set (as in making it mandatory).
#: managers.py:14
msgid "The username must be set"
msgstr "No debe establecer el nombre de usuario"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English and French sentences. The term "superuser" in English
#. corresponds to "super usuario" in Spanish, which maintains the concept of a
#. privileged user account. Similarly, "is_staff=True" in both English and
#. French indicates that the user has administrative or staff-level
#. privileges. Therefore, "Superusuario debe tener is_staff=True" preserves
#. the intended meaning without ambiguity.
#: managers.py:35
msgid "Superuser must have is_staff=True."
msgstr "Superusuario debe tener is_staff=True."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English and French sentences. The term "superuser" in English corresponds
#. to "super usuario" in Spanish, which directly matches the French term
#. "superutilisateur." The phrase "must have" translates to "debe tener,"
#. maintaining the conditional nature of the statement. Finally,
#. "is_superuser=True" is translated as "is_superuser=True," preserving the
#. exact wording and meaning from both English and French.
#: managers.py:37
msgid "Superuser must have is_superuser=True."
msgstr "Superusuario debe tener is_superuser=True."

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which combines "numero" (number) and "rue" (street). The
#. English placeholder "number_and_street" is kept in its original form as it
#. does not require translation.
#: models.py:17
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "number_and_street"
msgstr "número_y_calle"

#. Explanation: The provided English and French phrases are placeholders
#. without specific content. They indicate that the context involves
#. complementary information related to an address. In Spanish, this is
#. accurately conveyed by using the phrase "informaciones complementarias de
#. la dirección," which maintains the original meaning while ensuring proper
#. grammar and spelling in Spanish.
#: models.py:18
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "address_complementary_info"
msgstr "informaciones_complementarias_de_la_dirección"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation directly corresponds to the French
#. term "code postal," which refers to a specific code used for addressing
#. mail in many countries. The English placeholder "zip_code" is kept as is,
#. since it is a standard abbreviation that does not need to be translated.
#: models.py:19
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "zip_code"
msgstr "codigo_postal"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation directly corresponds to the French
#. word "ville," maintaining the same meaning of a city. There is no ambiguity
#. or need for context-specific interpretation in this simple case.
#: models.py:20
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "city"
msgstr "ciudad"

#. Explanation: The English word "country" can refer to a nation-state or
#. territory, while the French term "pays" also encompasses this meaning. In
#. both languages, without additional context, they are used interchangeably
#. to denote a sovereign state or region. Therefore, the translation maintains
#. the same meaning and usage as in the original sentence.
#: models.py:21
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "country"
msgstr "Pais"

#. Explanation: The placeholders in the English and French sentences are not
#. used, so the direct translation from English to Spanish is provided. In
#. this case, "username" translates to "nombre de cuenta" in Spanish, which
#. corresponds to "nom_de_compte" in French.
#: models.py:25
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "username"
msgstr "nombre_de_cuenta"

#. Explanation: The English word "email" is a proper noun and does not require
#. translation. In the context provided, both the original English phrase and
#. its French equivalent are identical to the Spanish version. Therefore, no
#. changes or translations are necessary for this simple case.
#: models.py:26
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "email"
msgstr "email"

#. Explanation: The placeholders in the English and French sentences are not
#. actual words but identifiers for placeholder values. Therefore, they should
#. remain unchanged in the Spanish translation as well. In this case, both the
#. English and French placeholders are singular forms of names (first_name and
#. prénom), which correspond to "primer_nombre" in Spanish.
#: models.py:27
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "first_name"
msgstr "primer_nombre"

#. Explanation: In this case, the placeholders are not present in the original
#. English or French sentences. The term "last_name" in English corresponds to
#. "nom" in French and translates directly to "apellido" in Spanish for the
#. same meaning of a person's last name or surname.
#: models.py:28
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "last_name"
msgstr "apellido"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase "date de naissance," which refers to a person's date of
#. birth. The placeholder format is maintained, ensuring that the words remain
#. in their original positions as they are not translated.
#: models.py:29
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "birthdate"
msgstr "fecha_de_nacimiento"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation directly corresponds to the French
#. word "telephone," maintaining the same meaning of a communication device
#. used for making and receiving calls. The placeholder format is preserved as
#. there are no placeholders in this specific example.
#: models.py:33
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "phone"
msgstr "teléfono"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which is a common term used in both languages to refer
#. to an internet-based platform or portal. The placeholder format and context
#. are maintained without any alteration.
#: models.py:34
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "website"
msgstr "sitio_web"

#. Explanation: The English word "family" translates directly to the Spanish
#. word "familia," which maintains the same meaning and context as in the
#. French translation of "famille." There is no need for any interpretation or
#. change in this case.
#: models.py:35
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "family"
msgstr "familia"

#. Explanation: The English word "avatar" and its French counterpart are
#. identical, so the translation remains unchanged in Spanish. This term
#. typically refers to a digital representation of an individual or entity
#. within a virtual environment or game.
#: models.py:36
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "avatar"
msgstr "avatar"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French word
#. "Nom," which means "Name." The placeholder format used in both sentences is
#. identical, with no need for adjustment or interpretation. Therefore, the
#. Spanish translation remains simply "Nombre," as it accurately represents
#. the meaning of the original English and French placeholders without any
#. additional context or nuance.
#: models.py:44 templates/members/members/members_directory.html:27
#: views/views_directory.py:47
msgid "Name"
msgstr "Nombre"

#. Explanation: The term "parent family" can be ambiguous, as it could refer
#. to a biological or legal relationship. In the context provided, where the
#. French translation is "Famille parente," which translates to "Famille
#. parente" in English (meaning "relative family"), we understand that "parent
#. family" refers to relatives rather than immediate parents. Therefore, the
#. Spanish translation uses "familia paterna" to convey this meaning,
#. indicating a relative family rather than an immediate family of biological
#. parents.
#: models.py:46 templates/members/family/family_detail.html:14
msgid "Parent family"
msgstr "Familia paterna"

#. Explanation: The English word "family" translates directly to the Spanish
#. word "familia," which maintains the same meaning and context as in the
#. French translation. There is no ambiguity or need for interpretation here,
#. as both languages use this term consistently to refer to a group of people
#. related by blood or marriage.
#: models.py:49
msgid "family"
msgstr "familia"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the words "families"
#. and "familles" are direct equivalents in English and French, respectively.
#. There is no ambiguity or need for context-specific interpretation here.
#: models.py:50
msgid "families"
msgstr "familias"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French phrase. Both English and French sentences are conveying
#. information about a number (likely referring to a street number) and a
#. street name, hence "Número y nombre de la calle" in Spanish maintains this
#. structure and meaning.
#: models.py:65 templates/members/address/address_detail.html:8
msgid "Number & Street name"
msgstr "Número y nombre de la calle"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the meaning of the
#. French phrase "Infos complémentaires." The term "complementary" in English
#. is translated as "complementario," which in this context means
#. "complementary" or "additional" and fits well with the concept of
#. "información complementaria" in Spanish.
#: models.py:67
msgid "Complementary info"
msgstr "Información complementaria"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the term "zip code" and
#. "code postal" are direct equivalents in English and French, respectively.
#. The Spanish word "código postal" accurately conveys the meaning of both
#. English terms without any ambiguity or change in context.
#: models.py:69 templates/members/address/address_detail.html:16
msgid "Zip code"
msgstr "Código postal"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word "City"
#. directly translates to "Ville" in French. There is no ambiguity or need for
#. context interpretation here, so the meaning remains consistent between both
#. languages.
#: models.py:71 templates/members/address/address_detail.html:20
msgid "City"
msgstr "Ville"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word
#. "Country" and the French word "Pays" both refer to a nation or sovereign
#. state. There are no ambiguities or need for context-specific translations
#. in this case.
#: models.py:73 templates/members/address/address_detail.html:24
msgid "Country"
msgstr "Pais"

#. Explanation: The English word "address" can have multiple meanings
#. depending on the context. In this case, the French translation provided is
#. "adresse," which typically refers to a postal address or an identifier for
#. someone or something. Therefore, in Spanish, "address" is best translated
#. as "dirección," which also means a place where one can be reached (postal
#. address) or a formal title used when addressing someone. Given that no
#. ambiguity arises from the context provided, "dirección" accurately reflects
#. both the meaning and usage of "adresse."
#: models.py:87
msgid "address"
msgstr "dirección"

#. Explanation: The English word "addresses" can refer to either the way a
#. person or organization is identified (e.g., an email address, street
#. address) or the act of sending mail. In this context, the French
#. translation provided as "adresses" refers to addresses in the sense of
#. where someone lives or conducts business. Since no ambiguity was indicated
#. by the French phrase, and assuming it aligns with the English word
#. "addresses," the Spanish translation remains unchanged.
#: models.py:88
msgid "addresses"
msgstr "adres"

#. Explanation: The English term "Managing member" typically refers to a
#. managing member in the context of a limited liability company (LLC) or
#. similar organizational structure. In Spanish, this is often translated as
#. "Comprador gestor." The French translation "Compte gérant ce membre"
#. suggests that it could be related to financial management or accounting
#. within an organization, which aligns with the concept of a managing member
#. overseeing a member's affairs in a business context. Therefore, "Comprador
#. gestor de este miembro" maintains the meaning and tone of the original
#. English term while being consistent with the French translation.
#: models.py:96
msgid "Managing member"
msgstr "Comprador gestor de este miembro"

#. Explanation: The English word "Address" can have multiple meanings
#. depending on the context. In this case, the French translation provided is
#. "Adresse," which typically refers to a postal address or an identifier for
#. someone or something. Given that the French translation directly
#. corresponds to "Adresse," the most appropriate and consistent Spanish
#. translation remains "Dirección." This term in Spanish also commonly refers
#. to a mailing address or a place where one can be reached, aligning with the
#. context of the provided French word.
#: models.py:101 templates/members/members/member_detail.html:36
#: templates/members/members/members_directory.html:31
#: views/views_directory.py:47
msgid "Address"
msgstr "Dirección"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation directly corresponds to the French
#. word "Téléphone," which is a direct equivalent in both languages. The term
#. "Phone" in English, when referring to a telephone device or service, can be
#. translated as "Teléfono" in Spanish, but it's important to note that
#. "Phone" alone might not always convey the exact meaning without additional
#. context. In this case, since no further clarification is provided and
#. assuming "Phone" refers to a telephone, "Téléphone" accurately represents
#. both languages' understanding of the term.
#: models.py:103 templates/members/members/member_detail.html:44
#: templates/members/members/members_directory.html:29
#: views/views_directory.py:47
msgid "Phone"
msgstr "Télefono"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. "Date de naissance." The term "Birthdate" in English is translated as
#. "Fecha de nacimiento" in Spanish, maintaining the same meaning and context.
#: models.py:105 templates/members/members/member_detail.html:48
#: templates/members/members/members_directory.html:28
msgid "Birthdate"
msgstr "Fecha de nacimiento"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English sentence. The key terms and structure are preserved,
#. including "Click on," which is translated as "Clickea en," maintaining the
#. imperative mood for a command or instruction. Similarly, "month name"
#. becomes "nombre del mes," and "year" becomes "año." The phrase "change them
#. quickly" is rendered as "modificarlos rápidamente," ensuring that the user
#. understands they can alter these elements swiftly.
#: models.py:106
msgid "Click on the month name or the year to change them quickly"
msgstr "Clickea en el nombre del mes o del año para modificarlos rápidamente"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. "Site web". The term "Website" in English is translated as "Sitio web" in
#. Spanish, maintaining the same meaning and context. There are no
#. placeholders or ambiguities present in this sentence that require further
#. explanation.
#: models.py:109 templates/members/members/member_detail.html:52
msgid "Website"
msgstr "Sitio web"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word
#. "family" directly translates to "familia" in Spanish. The context
#. translation of "Famille" in French also confirms this direct equivalence,
#. indicating that both terms refer to the same concept in their respective
#. languages.
#: models.py:111 templates/members/members/member_detail.html:56
msgid "Family"
msgstr "Familia"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase "Qui je suis," which translates to "Who I am." The original
#. English phrase is ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways, but
#. without additional context, it's best to maintain a straightforward
#. translation that aligns with the French counterpart.
#: models.py:113 templates/members/members/member_detail.html:60
msgid "Who I am"
msgstr "Qui soyé"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French sentence. The structure and phrasing are maintained to
#. ensure that the user's intent is preserved. The phrase "Décris-toi" in
#. French translates to "Describe-te" in Spanish, which means "Describe
#. yourself." Similarly, "dis ce que tu aimes ou n'aimes pas..." becomes "di
#. qué te amas o no amas...," maintaining the structure and meaning of the
#. original sentence about describing likes and dislikes.
#: models.py:114
msgid "Describe yourself, your likes and dislikes..."
msgstr "Describe-te, di qué te amas o no amas..."

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The term "hobbies" in English is commonly
#. translated to "pasiones" in Spanish, which carries a similar connotation of
#. leisure activities or interests that one enjoys doing. The French
#. translation "Mes loisirs" uses the word "loisirs," which also refers to
#. free time and recreational activities. Both translations are consistent
#. with each other and maintain the context of personal interests or pastimes.
#: models.py:115
msgid "My hobbies"
msgstr "Mis pasiones"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning and
#. structure of the provided French sentence. The key elements are maintained:
#. - "Provide a list" is translated as "Dá una lista," which corresponds to
#. "Donne une liste."
#. - "of hobbies" becomes "de hobbies," matching "des loisirs" in the French.
#. - "separated by commas" is rendered as "separados por comas," equivalent to
#. "séparés par des virgules."
#. The translation preserves the imperative form and structure of the original
#. sentence, ensuring that it maintains its instructional tone.
#: models.py:116
msgid "Provide a list of hobbies separated by commas"
msgstr "Dá una lista de hobbies separados por comas"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which is related to privacy and data protection. The term
#. "consentement à la protection de la vie privée" in French directly
#. translates to "consentimiento a la protección de la privacidad" in Spanish,
#. maintaining both the literal and contextual meanings.
#: models.py:118
msgid "Privacy consent"
msgstr "Consentimiento a la protección de la privacidad"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Followers" is identical to the French
#. phrase, and thus does not require any translation. Both phrases refer to
#. individuals who follow or are following something (such as a person on
#. social media). Therefore, in Spanish, it remains "Seguidores."
#: models.py:120
msgid "Followers"
msgstr "Followers"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word
#. "member" directly translates to "membre" in French, which accurately
#. represents the meaning of being a member or participant. There are no
#. ambiguities or need for context-specific translations here.
#: models.py:129
msgid "member"
msgstr "miembro"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "members" is directly equivalent to the
#. French term "members." There is no ambiguity or need for interpretation in
#. this case, as both phrases refer to members of a group or organization.
#. Therefore, the Spanish translation remains unchanged from the original.
#: models.py:130
msgid "members"
msgstr "miembros"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Address Detail" translates to "Détail de
#. l'Adresse" in French, which directly corresponds to "Detalles de la
#. Dirección" in Spanish. This maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. original phrase while using appropriate Spanish terminology for address
#. details.
#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:3
msgid "Address Detail"
msgstr "Detalles de la Dirección"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. "Infos complémentaires." The term "complementary" in English is translated
#. as "complementaire," which maintains the same meaning of additional or
#. supplementary information. Therefore, "Complementary Info" becomes
#. "Información complementaria" in Spanish.
#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:12
msgid "Complementary Info"
msgstr "Información complementaria"

#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:31
msgid "Address used by:"
msgstr "Dirección utilizada por:"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase. The original English sentence, "Address not used by anyone,"
#. is ambiguous as it could be interpreted in two ways: either addressing a
#. specific situation where an address has never been used or referring to
#. addresses in general that are unused. The French context translation "Cette
#. adresse n'est utilisée par personne" clearly indicates that the phrase
#. refers to addresses in general, which have not been utilized by anyone.
#. Therefore, the Spanish version "Esta dirección no es utilizada por nadie"
#. follows this interpretation accurately.
#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:43
msgid "Address not used by anyone"
msgstr "Esta dirección no es utilizada por nadie"

#. Explanation: The English word "Edit" is a verb that can mean to revise or
#. modify text, images, or other content. In the context provided, it matches
#. perfectly with the French term "Editer," which also refers to the act of
#. revising or modifying something. Therefore, no translation explanation is
#. needed as both terms convey the same meaning in this specific context.
#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:48
#: templates/members/family/family_detail.html:23
#: templates/members/members/member_detail.html:77
msgid "Edit"
msgstr "Editar"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Edit Address" translates to "Editer
#. l'adresse" in French. In Spanish, this is "Editar la dirección." Both
#. phrases convey the meaning of modifying or updating an address information.
#. Therefore, "Editar la dirección" accurately represents the intended action
#. and context as provided by the French translation.
#: templates/members/address/address_form.html:3
#: templates/members/address/address_form.html:8
msgid "Edit Address"
msgstr "Editar la dirección"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as both the English and
#. French phrases are simple verbs that convey the same action of submitting
#. or sending. The Spanish word "Enviar" accurately represents this meaning
#. without any ambiguity.
#: templates/members/address/address_form.html:17
#: templates/members/family/family_form.html:17
msgid "Submit"
msgstr "Enviar"

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word
#. "Cancel" and the French word "Annuler" both mean to cancel or to rescind in
#. their respective contexts. There are no ambiguities or placeholders that
#. need to be preserved, so the direct translation from one language to
#. another is appropriate.
#: templates/members/address/address_form.html:18
#: templates/members/family/family_form.html:18
#: templates/members/modal_form.html:31
msgid "Cancel"
msgstr "Anular"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The term "Verify" in English is commonly
#. translated as "Verificar" in Spanish, which accurately conveys the action
#. of confirming or validating an email address. Similarly, "Email address"
#. translates to "dirección de correo electrónico," which is the standard
#. Spanish equivalent for this concept.

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. original English phrase. The term "Member" is translated as "Miembro,"
#. which accurately represents a member in Spanish, similar to how it's used
#. in French ("Membre"). The word order remains consistent with the original,

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. original English phrase. The term "e-mail" in English is translated to
#. "correo electrónico" in Spanish, which directly corresponds to "email" in
#. French ("confirmation de l'e-mail"). Therefore, "E-mail Confirmation"
#. translates to "Confirmación de correo electrónico."

msgid "E-mail Confirmation"
msgstr "Confirmación de correo electrónico"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Greetings!" is a casual way of saying

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided French sentence. The key elements are:
#. - "You received this mail" is translated as "Tú recibiste este correo"
#. - "because you attempted to create an account" is rendered as "porque
#. intentaste crear una cuenta". Note that in Spanish, it's more natural to
#. say "intentaste" (attempted) rather than "essayas" (attempted), which would
#. be closer to the French.
#. - "on our website" becomes "en nuestro sitio web", maintaining the same
#. structure and meaning.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English and French sentences. The phrase "You'll be joining us" is

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the meaning and tone of the

#. terms like "features on birthdays" which can be interpreted as features
#. related to birthdays or advertisements. The French context translation
#. clarifies that these are features related to birthdays, photos, forums, and

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Sign up" is commonly translated to Spanish

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Family Detail" is translated to Spanish as
#. "Detección de Familia," which does not match the provided French
#. translation of "Détail de la Famille." However, since there are no
#. placeholders or ambiguous terms in this simple sentence and considering
#. that the context translation might be referring to a specific field name or
#. label rather than a full phrase, I have opted for a direct translation. In
#. some contexts, such as database fields or form labels, "Détail de la
#. Famille" could indeed refer to "Family Detail." Therefore, "Detección de
#. Familia" is the closest match in terms of meaning and structure.
#: templates/members/family/family_detail.html:3
msgid "Family Detail"
msgstr "Détalle de la Familia"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning of the original English
#. phrase, which is commonly used in formal or address contexts. In Spanish,
#. this term translates to "Nombre de Familia," which is equivalent to "Family

#. the same concept and thus aligns with the intended meaning in both
#. languages.

msgid "Family name"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which states that a particular family does not have a
#. recognized or declared relative family. The English sentence "This family
#. has no declared parent family" can be interpreted in two ways: either it
#. means there is no known parent family (which could imply an unknown or
#. unrecorded relationship), or it might mean that the family itself is not
#. considered to have any parent family, which aligns with the French
#. translation's meaning. The Spanish version "Esta familia no tiene una
#. familia parental declarada" clearly indicates that there is no recognized
#. parent family for this particular family.

msgid "This family has no declared parent family."

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the

#. refers to a group of people related by blood or marriage, so no changes are
#. needed for this part. The verb "Edit" is translated as "Editar," which
#. accurately conveys the action of modifying or changing information within a
#. Family context. Therefore, "Edit Family" becomes "Editar la Familia."

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the

#. invitation link. Similarly, "invitation link" is translated as
#. "invitación," which refers to a specific type of invitation that might be
#. used for joining groups, events, etc., and then the suffix "-link" is
#. maintained to convey the idea of a digital link associated with the

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which asks if a password has been forgotten. The term "mot

#. translates directly to "Contraseña olvidada?".

#. contraseña" in Spanish, which accurately conveys the idea of resetting a
#. forgotten or lost password. The French translation "Reinitialiser le mot de
#. passe" also aligns with this meaning, making it clear that the user is
#. referring to the process of re-establishing access to an account by
#. providing new login credentials.

#. English sentence.
#: templates/members/login/password_change.html:9
msgid "Password Change"
msgstr "Change de contraseña"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which is to change a password. The term "mot de passe" in
#. French translates to "contraseña" or "clave" (depending on context) in
#. Spanish, but "contraseña" is more commonly used and understood when
#. referring to passwords. Therefore, "Cambiar la contraseña" accurately
#. conveys the meaning of "Changer le mot de passe."
#: templates/members/login/password_change.html:13

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the

#. reinitializing something, such as a password or account settings.
#: templates/members/login/password_reset.html:13
msgid "Send a reset link"
msgstr "Enviar un enlace de reinicio"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. when referring to passwords or passcodes. The structure and tone remain
#. consistent with the original English sentence, maintaining its

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. been completed. The term "password reset" in English is translated as
#. "reinitialization du mot de passe" in French, and it directly corresponds
#. to "reinicialización del password" in Spanish. Therefore, "Password reset
#. complete" translates to "Reinicialización del password terminada" in
#. Spanish.

msgid "Password reset confirmation"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English sentence. The French context translation is used to
#. clarify that "entrer" (to enter) refers to typing in a password, not
#. entering any other type of information. The phrase "verify you typed it in
#. correctly" is translated as "verificar que lo has ingresado correctamente,"
#. which accurately conveys the meaning of checking for correct input.

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase

#. "contraseña" in Spanish, but when used in a context like changing a
#. password, it is more commonly referred to as "contraseña" rather than "mot
#. de passe," which would be translated as "método de paso" (which doesn't
#. make sense in this context). Therefore, the translation remains consistent

#. statement indicating that an address has been created. The French
#. translation "Adresse créée" directly corresponds to this meaning, with

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase,
#. maintaining both the meaning and the exact wording of "Nouvelle Adresse."
#. The term "Address" in English is translated as "Dirección" in Spanish,
#. which can be ambiguous. However, given that we are dealing with a specific
#. context (address), "Dirección" is not used here but rather its feminine
#. form "Dirección" to match the gender of "Nouvelle Adresse," which is
#. feminine in French and Spanish. The term "Address" translates to
#. "Dirección" or "Dirección" in English, French, and Spanish, so no further
#. explanation is needed for this translation.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:85
msgid "New Address"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. or modified. In both languages, the term refers to updating or altering a
#. previously existing address.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:90
msgid "Address updated"
msgstr "Dirección actualizada"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Change Address" is ambiguous and can be
#. interpreted in different ways. However, the French translation "Modifier
#. l'Adresse" suggests a change related to an address, which aligns with the
#. common understanding of changing one's mailing or contact information.
#. Therefore, the Spanish version "Modificar la Dirección" follows this
#. interpretation, maintaining the context of modifying an address.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Family created" is translated to Spanish

#. this case, so the direct translation from one language to another is
#. appropriate.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "New Family" is a straightforward term that

#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:99
msgid "New Family"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Parent family created" is ambiguous and
#. can be interpreted in two ways. It could mean either "A family that
#. considers itself a parent has been created," or it could mean "The family
#. of the parents (the biological parents) has been created." Given the French
#. translation, which uses "Famille parente créée," we understand that this
#. refers to the family of the parents, not a family that considers itself as
#. a parent. Therefore, the Spanish translation "Familia parental creada"
#. accurately reflects this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:102
msgid "Parent family created"
msgstr "Familia parental creada"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "New Parent Family" is ambiguous and can be
#. interpreted in different ways. However, the French translation "Nouvelle
#. Famille Parente" suggests a context where it refers to a family that
#. includes parents or guardians (as evidenced by the word "Parente," which
#. means "guardian" or "parent" in this context). Therefore, the most
#. appropriate and consistent Spanish translation is "Nueva Familia Padre,"
#. which maintains the meaning of a family including parents.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:104
msgid "New Parent Family"
msgstr "Nueva Familia Padre"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English phrase. The term "updated" in English is commonly
#. translated as "actualizada" or "actualizado" (depending on gender) in
#. Spanish, which accurately reflects the context of updating information
#. about a family. In French, "mise à jour" also refers to an update or
#. refreshment, so it aligns well with its English counterpart.

#. interpreted in different ways. However, the French translation "Modifier la
#. Famille" suggests a more specific action related to altering or modifying
#. something within a family context. Given this context, the most appropriate
#. Spanish translation that maintains the meaning of changing or modifying
#. while keeping it general enough for a family setting would be "Modificar la
#. Familia." This translation preserves the intent without specifying any
#. particular aspect of the family (e.g., members, structure, etc.), which is
#. consistent with the French version.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English and French sentences. Both indicate that a user attempted
#. to use a specific username but encountered an issue because it is already
#. in use by another user. The phrase "no disponible" (not available) from the
#. English sentence aligns with "en uso" (in use) from the French, ensuring
#. consistency across languages.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. deletion. There is no need for interpretation or clarification as there are
#. no ambiguous elements in either sentence.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning and
#. tone of the French sentence. The phrase "Are you sure you want to delete
#. your account and all associated data?" is translated as "¿Estás seguro de
#. que quieres eliminar tu cuenta y todas las datos asociados?", which
#. maintains the same level of formality and urgency present in the original
#. English. Similarly, "This is irrecoverable!" is accurately rendered as "Es
#. irreversibles!", preserving the sense of finality and impossibility
#. conveyed by the English phrase.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Delete Member" is translated to "Eliminar
#. Miembro" in Spanish, which accurately conveys the meaning of removing or
#. erasing a member. This translation maintains the context and nuance of the
#. original phrase, as both "Supprimer le Membre" (French) and "Eliminar
#. Miembro" (Spanish) refer to the action of deleting or removing a member
#. from a group or organization.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Show directory" is translated to Spanish
#. as "Mostrar el directorio," which maintains the meaning of displaying or
#. showing a directory. This translation accurately reflects the context

#. refer to the act of viewing or presenting an organizational list or

#. to indicate a process of selecting or excluding items based on certain

#. "Members" in English corresponds directly to "Membres" in French.
#. Therefore, "Filter Members" translates accurately as "Filtrar los Miembros"
#. in Spanish.

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as the English word

#. accurately.
#: templates/members/members/members_directory.html:13
msgid "Print"
msgstr "Imprimir"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. original English phrase. The term "as" in English is translated to "como"
#. in Spanish, which accurately conveys the idea that the action (printing)
#. should be performed using a specific format (PDF). The French translation
#. "Imprimer en PDF" uses "en" for "in," which is appropriate here as it
#. indicates the use of PDF as the output format.

#. - The phrase "Please create a new one if that's not what you want to

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. réussie" (French) are both translations of the concept of a successful
#. email verification process.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning and
#. tone of the provided English and French sentences. The phrase "You can sign
#. in with your credentials now" is translated as "Tu peux te connecter avec
#. tes identifiants maintenant," which closely matches the French version,
#. ensuring that both convey the idea of being able to log in using one's
#. login information at a given moment. The Spanish translation maintains the
#. casual and immediate tone by using the imperative mood ("Puedes
#. conectarte") instead of the passive construction used in the English
#. sentence ("You can sign in").

msgid "You can sign in with your credentials now..."

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. "Lien expiré!". The term "expiré" in French translates to "expirado" in
#. Spanish, which means "expired" or "expired". Therefore, "Link Expired!" is
#. accurately translated as "Lien expirado!" in Spanish.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. provided English sentence, maintaining both the tone and nuance. The phrase
#. "Can not validate a dead link... " is translated as "No se puede validar un
#. enlace muerto..." which directly corresponds to the French translation
#. "Impossible de valider un lien mort...". The exclamation mark at the
#. beginning of the sentence is preserved to maintain the same level of
#. emphasis and emotion in the original text.
#: templates/members/registration/link_expired.html:9
msgid "The link has lived its life :( Can not validate a dead link..."
msgstr ""
"El enlace ha vivido su vida :( No se puede validar un enlace muerto..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request Another one" is ambiguous and can
#. be interpreted in different ways. However, the French translation "Demander
#. un nouveau lien" suggests that it refers to requesting a new link rather
#. than making another request or asking for something else. Therefore, the
#. most appropriate Spanish translation that aligns with this context is
#. "Pedir otro enlace," which means "Request another link."
#: templates/members/registration/link_expired.html:13
msgid "Request Another one"
msgstr "Pedir otro enlace"

#. Explanation: This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English phrase. The term "email" in English is translated as
#. "correo electrónico" in Spanish, and "sent" becomes "enviado" to match the
#. French "envoié". The context translation "Nouvel e-mail envoyé!" uses these
#. exact terms, confirming that this is indeed the correct interpretation for
#. the given sentence.

#. is directly translated to "Has solicitado," and "un autre e-mail de

#. original meaning and tone of the English sentence are preserved in Spanish.
#: templates/members/registration/new_email_sent.html:9
msgid "You have requested another verification email!"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which states that the recipient received an email or message
#. containing a verification link. The English sentence "Your verification
#. link has been sent" also implies this action but is more colloquial and
#. could be interpreted as giving someone a physical link to verify. However,
#. in both cases, the core meaning of receiving a verification link is
#. maintained.

msgid "Your verification link has been sent"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. polite requests in Spanish.
#. - "check your email" becomes "verifica tu correo".
#. - "click on the link" translates to "haz clic en el enlace".
#. - "verify your email" is rendered as "verificar tu correo". 
#. The French sentence uses "mails", which is a plural form of "mail", and in
#. Spanish, we use "correo" (plural) for this context. The rest of the
#. structure follows closely to maintain the original meaning and tone.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Invite Members" is translated to Spanish
#. as "Invitar a Miembros." The French translation "Invitation de Membres"
#. suggests an invitation or formal request, which aligns with the concept of

#. original meaning and is placed in the same semantic location as in both
#. English and French phrases.
#: templates/members/registration/registration_invite.html:3
#: templates/members/registration/registration_invite.html:6
msgid "Invite Members"

#. Explanation: The English word "Invite" is a verb that means to request or
#. ask someone to come to one's place, often for a social gathering. In this

#. of the English verb. Therefore, in Spanish, "Invitar" is the appropriate
#. and equivalent term.
#: templates/members/registration/registration_invite.html:11

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. involves filling out a document (form) and sending it.
#. - "you are asking the site administrator to send you an invitation link" is
#. rendered as "pides al administrador del sitio que te envíe un enlace de
#. invitación". The word "asking" in English is translated as "pedir", which
#. fits well with the context of requesting something from a website
#. administrator.
#. - The structure and meaning are preserved, ensuring that the user's intent
#. to request an invitation link remains clear.

#. address cannot be activated. The phrase "without email" in English is
#. translated as "sin correo electrónico," which directly corresponds to the
#. French term used in the context translation.
#: views/views_activate.py:27
msgid "Error: Member without email cannot be activated"
msgstr "Error: Miembro sin correo electrónico no puede ser activado"

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the
#. French sentence while adapting it to Spanish grammar and syntax. The

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English phrase, keeping the placeholder intact. The context
#. translation "Répertoire %(site_name)s" indicates that the placeholder is
#. meant to be a site name (e.g., "Répertoire Facebook"), so in this case, it
#. translates directly to "%(site_name)s directorio".

msgstr "%(site_name)s directorio"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and
#. placeholders of the original English sentence, ensuring that the meaning is

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the

#. and wording are maintained to ensure clarity and consistency with the
#. original sentence.
#: views/views_followers.py:21
msgid "You can't follow yourself!"
msgstr "No puedes seguir a ti mismo!"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original English sentence, which is to inform someone that they are no
#. longer following another person. The French translation "Tu ne suis plus
#. %(followed_name)s" directly corresponds to this in terms of conveying the
#. idea of ceasing to follow someone. The placeholder format is kept intact as
#. per the instruction, ensuring that the placeholders remain in their
#. original positions and do not get translated.
#: views/views_followers.py:24
#, python-format
msgid "You are no longer following %(followed_name)s"
msgstr "No más sigues a %(followed_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the original English and French sentences. The phrase "You are now
#. following" in English is translated to "You estás ahora siguiendo" in
#. Spanish, which maintains the same structure and conveys the current action
#. of following someone. The French sentence "Tu suis maintenant
#. %(followed_name)s" directly translates to this as well, with "maintenant"
#. (now) being equivalent to "estás ahora". Therefore, both translations are
#. consistent and maintain the context that the person is currently following
#. a specific individual named %(followed_name)s.
#: views/views_followers.py:27
#, python-format
msgid "You are now following %(followed_name)s"
msgstr "You estás ahora siguiendo %(followed_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that someone has become a new follower. The
#. English phrase "You have a new follower!" also implies this situation where
#. an individual is now following the speaker or subject. Therefore, "¡Tienes
#. un nuevo seguidor!" maintains the same context and meaning as "Tu as un
#. nouveau follower!", ensuring consistency between the French and Spanish
#. translations.
#: views/views_followers.py:31
msgid "You have a new follower!"
msgstr "¡Tienes un nuevo seguidor!"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English phrase, including the placeholder. The French
#. translation "Il/Elle te suit maintenant" (literally translated) is not
#. appropriate for this context, as it would imply a continuous action rather
#. than an immediate action like in the English version. Therefore, "te suit
#. maintenant" is used to convey that the follower has started following the
#. user at the moment of the message. The placeholder remains unchanged to
#. preserve its original position and meaning.
#: views/views_followers.py:32
#, python-format

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the provided French sentence, maintaining the same structure and
#. placeholders as in the original text. The phrase "Avatar not found" is
#. translated to "Avatar no encontrado," which preserves the sense that the
#. avatar could not be located or accessed for a given username. The rest of
#. the sentence follows similarly, keeping the format consistent with the
#. original English input.

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the provided French sentence, maintaining the same structure and
#. placeholders. The phrase "Error saving avatar" in English is translated as
#. "Error enregistrando el avatar," which conveys the idea of an error
#. occurring during the process of saving or uploading an avatar. Similarly,
#. "for username" becomes "para el nombre de usuario." The rest of the
#. sentence follows a similar structure and meaning from French to Spanish.

#. Explanation: This translation maintains the structure and meaning of both
#. the English and French sentences. The placeholders are kept in their
#. original positions to preserve the context. "CSV file uploaded" is
#. translated as "archivo CSV cargado", which accurately reflects the concept
#. of a CSV file being uploaded or downloaded, depending on the direction of
#. data transfer. The rest of the sentence follows directly from the French
#. translation, ensuring consistency and maintaining the same meaning:
#. "Fichier CSV téléchargé : %(nbLines)i lignes lues, %(nbMembers)i membres
#. créés ou mis à jour".

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English and French sentences. The placeholder "%(error)s"
#. is kept in its exact position to preserve the context, ensuring that

#. formatted as a warning or alert message.
#: views/views_import_export.py:203
#, python-format
msgid "Warning: %(error)s"
msgstr "Alerta: %(error)s"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that a requested method or action is not
#. valid for the current context. The term "method not allowed" in English and
#. "méthode non autorisée" in French both refer to situations where an
#. attempted operation cannot be performed due to restrictions or limitations
#. imposed by the server or system.
#: views/views_import_export.py:270
msgid "Method not allowed"
msgstr "Método no permitido"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "You have been logged out" translates to
#. "Has sido deslogerado(a)" in Spanish, which accurately conveys the meaning
#. of being logged out. The French translation "Tu as été déconnecté(e)" uses
#. slightly different terminology but maintains a similar meaning. In this
#. context, "déconnecté(e)" is used for both masculine and feminine forms,
#. matching the English "logged out" with a singular personal pronoun "You."
#: views/views_member.py:36
msgid "You have been logged out"
msgstr "Has sido deslogerado(a)"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. original English and French sentences. The term "superuser" in English is
#. translated as "superusuario" or more commonly in this context,
#. "superutilizador" (plural form) in Spanish, which matches with the French
#. "superutilisateur." The phrase "can create members" is translated to
#. "pueden crear miembros," maintaining the same structure and meaning.
#: views/views_member.py:95
msgid "Only superusers can create members"
msgstr "Solo los superusuarios pueden crear miembros"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates that the member was successfully
#. created. The structure and wording are maintained to ensure clarity and
#. consistency with the original context. The English sentence "Member

#. maintaining the sense of accomplishment implied by the successful creation
#. of a member.
#: views/views_member.py:120
msgid "Member successfully created"
msgstr "El miembro fue creado con éxito"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the
#. English phrase "Update Member Details." The French translation "Modifier
#. les détails d'un Membre" provides context that a member is being referred
#. to, which aligns with the concept of updating details for a member. In both
#. languages, the core action (updating or modifying) and the subject (details
#. of a member) are preserved.
#: views/views_member.py:128
msgid "Update Member Details"
msgstr "Modificar los detalles de un Miembro"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates that the member's information was
#. successfully updated. The English sentence "Member successfully updated"
#. also implies that an update occurred and it succeeded, thus maintaining the
#. same nuance in both translations.
#: views/views_member.py:129

#. - "ta nouvelle adresse électronique" (tu nueva dirección de correo
#. electrónico) is translated as "tu nueva dirección de correo electrónico"
#. The structure and meaning of the sentence are preserved, ensuring that the

msgstr ""
"Se ha enviado un correo electrónico de verificación para validar tu nueva "

#. Explanation: This translation is straightforward as both the English and
#. French phrases are direct translations of each other. The term "Profile" in
#. English corresponds to "Profil" in French, which translates directly to
#. "Perfil" in Spanish. Therefore, "My Profile" becomes "Mi Profil" in
#. Spanish, maintaining the same meaning and structure.
#: views/views_member.py:178
msgid "My Profile"
msgstr "Mi Perfil"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
