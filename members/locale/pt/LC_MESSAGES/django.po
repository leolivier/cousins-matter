#. Explanation: The English word "members" can refer to individuals who belong
#. to a group or organization, but the French translation "membres" is more
#. general and can also mean "members" in a broader sense, such as in
#. mathematics (set of members) or in other contexts.
#: apps.py:8
msgid "Members"
msgstr "membros"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the name of the invited person will appear in
#. the received email. The English sentence is slightly ambiguous, as it could
#. also mean "the name of the person who sent the email". However, the context
#. provided by the French translation makes it clear that it refers to the
#. recipient's email, so the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: forms.py:109
msgid "Name of the invited person (will appear in the received email)"
msgstr "Nome da pessoa convidada (aparecerá no e-mail recebido)"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that it is an email used to send an invitation. The
#. English phrase "Email to send invitation" can be ambiguous, as it could
#. refer to any type of email. The French translation makes it clear that it
#. is specifically for sending invitations, so the Portuguese version follows
#. this interpretation.
#: forms.py:110
msgid "Email to send invitation"
msgstr "Email para enviar uma convite"

#. Explanation: The French translation "Ton nom" is used to address someone,
#. whereas the English phrase "Your name" can be a question or an inquiry
#. about someone's identity. In Portuguese, we use "Seu nome" to refer to
#. someone's name in general, without any specific context of addressing or
#. questioning.
#: forms.py:114
msgid "Your name"
msgstr "Seu nome"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the email contains a link that will be
#. received by the recipient. The English phrase is somewhat ambiguous, but
#. the French translation makes it clear that it's an email with a link to be
#. received, so the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: forms.py:115
msgid "Email where you will receive the link"
msgstr "Email onde você receberá o link"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a formal and polite way to address an administrator. The
#. English phrase "Message to the administrator" is clear and direct, but in
#. Portuguese, it's more common to use the word "mensagem" (meaning message)
#. followed by "para o administrador", which conveys the same idea with a
#. slightly different tone.
#: forms.py:116
msgid "Message to the administrator"
msgstr "mensagem para o administrador"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user needs to click on the image to
#. refresh it if they are unable to read it. The English phrase "Captcha
#. (click on the image to refresh if you can't read it)" is clear about the
#. action required, while the French and Portuguese translations make this
#. requirement explicit by using the verb "rafraîchir" (to refresh).
#: forms.py:117
msgid "Captcha (click on the image to refresh if you can't read it)"
msgstr "Capcha (clique na imagem para refrescar se você não consegue ler)"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "CSV file" is commonly used to refer to a
#. plain text file that contains comma-separated values. In Portuguese, the
#. term "arquivo" is used to translate "file", and "CSV" remains unchanged as
#. it's an abbreviation for a specific format.
#: forms.py:132
msgid "CSV file"
msgstr "Arquivo CSV"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a specific CSV file that contains the members to be
#. imported. The English phrase is more general and could refer to any CSV
#. file with member data, whereas the French and Portuguese translations make
#. it clear that it's a specific file intended for importing.
#: forms.py:133
msgid "The CSV file containing the members to import."
msgstr "O arquivo CSV que contém os membros para importar."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the action should be performed automatically
#. for the imported users. The English phrase and its context translation
#. convey a sense of automation, so the Portuguese version "Ativar
#. automaticamente os usuários importados" follows this interpretation.
#: forms.py:137
msgid "Automatically activate imported users"
msgstr "Ativar automaticamente os usuários importados"

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the username must be provided or defined. The
#. English sentence can be ambiguous, as it only states a requirement without
#. specifying what needs to be done. The French translation makes it clear
#. that the user needs to provide the username, so the Portuguese version "O
#. nome de usuário deve ser definido" follows this interpretation.
#: managers.py:14
msgid "The username must be set"
msgstr "O nome de usuário deve ser definido"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the superuser must have a certain attribute
#. (is_staff) set to True. The English sentence and its context translation
#. make it clear that "is_staff" is an attribute or property, so the
#. Portuguese version uses the verb "ter" (to have) in the present tense,
#. indicating a necessary condition for being a superuser.
#: managers.py:35
msgid "Superuser must have is_staff=True."
msgstr "O superusuário deve ter is_staff=True."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the superuser has a specific attribute
#. (is_superuser) set to True. The English sentence and its context
#. translation make it clear that "must have" implies a requirement or
#. necessity, so the Portuguese version maintains this nuance.
#: managers.py:37
msgid "Superuser must have is_superuser=True."
msgstr "O usuário de superação deve ter is_superuser=True."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a combination of number and street. The English
#. phrase "number_and_street" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "number"
#. and "street" separately. The French translation makes it clear that it is a
#. combination, so the Portuguese version "número e rua" follows this
#. interpretation.
#: models.py:17
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "number_and_street"
msgstr "número e rua"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that it refers to additional information about an
#. address. The English term "address_complementary_info" suggests a specific
#. type of information related to an address, and the Portuguese version
#. "Informações complementares de endereço" follows this interpretation.
#: models.py:18
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "address_complementary_info"
msgstr "Informações complementares de endereço"

#. Explanation: The English term "zip code" refers to a specific format of
#. postal codes used in the United States, whereas the French term
#. "code_postal" is more general and can refer to any type of postal code. In
#. this translation, I have maintained consistency with the French translation
#. by using the same term for the concept, but note that the Portuguese
#. equivalent may vary depending on the context.
#: models.py:19
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "zip_code"
msgstr "codigo_postal"

#. Explanation: The English word "city" is translated to the Portuguese word
#. "cidade", which refers to a large human settlement. This translation is
#. consistent with the French translation "ville", which also means city or
#. town, and maintains the same meaning in both languages.
#: models.py:20
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "city"
msgstr "cidade"

#. Explanation: The English word "country" refers to a nation or state, while
#. the French word "pays" also encompasses this meaning. However, in some
#. contexts, "pays" can specifically refer to a region within France, whereas
#. "país" is more commonly used to refer to a country in general.
#: models.py:21
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "country"
msgstr "País"

#. Explanation: The English term "username" is commonly used to refer to a
#. user's chosen name or identifier on a computer system, network, or online
#. platform. In Portuguese, the equivalent term is "nome de usuário", which
#. literally means "user name".
#: models.py:25
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "username"
msgstr "nome de usuário"

#. Explanation: The English word "email" is a common abbreviation for
#. "electronic mail". In Portuguese, the translation maintains this meaning.
#: models.py:26
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "email"
msgstr "e-mail"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "first_name" typically refers to a person's
#. given name, while the French phrase "prenom" also means "given name". In
#. Portuguese, the equivalent term is "nome", which maintains the same meaning
#. and connotation as both the English and French phrases.
#: models.py:27
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "first_name"
msgstr "Nome"

#. Explanation: The English word "last_name" typically refers to a person's
#. surname, while the French word "nom" can refer to both surname and given
#. name. In this context, it is likely that the translator intended to use the
#. Portuguese word "nome", which specifically means surname.
#: models.py:28
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "last_name"
msgstr "Nome"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a specific term used to refer to a person's birth date.
#. The English word "birthdate" can be ambiguous in certain contexts, but in
#. this case, it refers to a person's birthdate, making the Portuguese
#. translation "Data de nascimento" an accurate and precise choice.
#: models.py:29
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "birthdate"
msgstr "Data de nascimento"

#. Explanation: The English word "phone" and the French word "telephone" are
#. synonyms, referring to a device used for communication. The Portuguese
#. translation "telefone" is consistent with the French translation,
#. maintaining the same meaning and nuance.
#: models.py:33
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "phone"
msgstr "Telefone"

#. Explanation: The French translation "site_web" is a compound word that
#. includes the general term for website, which is "site". This suggests that
#. the English phrase "website" can be translated to Portuguese as simply
#. "site", without any additional context or nuances.
#: models.py:34
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "website"
msgstr "site"

#. Explanation: The English word "family" and the French word "famille" share
#. a similar meaning, referring to a group of people related by blood or
#. marriage. In Portuguese, the translation is "família".
#: models.py:35
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "family"
msgstr "Família"

#. Explanation: The English and French translations are identical, suggesting
#. that the term "avatar" is widely recognized and used in both languages
#. without any specific cultural or contextual nuances.
#: models.py:36
msgctxt "CSV Field"
msgid "avatar"
msgstr "Avatar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Name" and the French word "Nom" both refer
#. to a person's or thing's identity, so the Portuguese translation "Nome" is
#. consistent with the meaning of the original words.
#: models.py:44 templates/members/members/members_directory.html:27
#: views/views_directory.py:47
msgid "Name"
msgstr "Nome"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Parent family" can be ambiguous, as it can
#. refer to either a biological or adoptive family. However, the French
#. translation "Famille parente" suggests that it is an adoptive or
#. stepfamily, which is not explicitly stated in the original English
#. sentence. Therefore, the Portuguese translation "Família" maintains the
#. ambiguity and neutrality of the original phrase.
#: models.py:46 templates/members/family/family_detail.html:14
msgid "Parent family"
msgstr "Família"

#. Explanation: The English word "family" and the French word "famille" both
#. refer to a group of people related by birth, marriage, or adoption. In

msgid "families"
msgstr "Famílias"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that it is a street address with both a number and
#. a street name. The English phrase "Number & Street name" can be ambiguous,
#. as it could refer to either a single unit or an address with multiple
#. components. The French translation makes it clear that it is a complete
#. address, so the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: models.py:65 templates/members/address/address_detail.html:8
msgid "Number & Street name"
msgstr "Número e nome da rua"

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same meaning and tone
#. as the French original, using the word "complementares" to convey the idea

msgid "City"
msgstr "Cidade"

msgid "Country"
msgstr "País"

#. Explanation: The English word "address" can refer to a physical location or
#. an email address. In the context of the French translation "adresse", it is
#. likely referring to a physical location, so the Portuguese translation
#. "Endereço" follows this interpretation.
#: models.py:87
msgid "address"
msgstr "Endereço"

#. Explanation: The French translation contains a typo, with an extra 's' at
#. the end. The Portuguese translation corrects this error and maintains
#. consistency with the intended meaning of the original phrase.
#: models.py:88
msgid "addresses"
msgstr "endereços"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a specific type of account or membership that is
#. managed by someone else. The English phrase "Managing member" can be
#. ambiguous, but in this context, it seems to refer to a person who has
#. control over an account or membership, making the Portuguese version
#. "Membro gerente" a suitable translation.
#: models.py:96
msgid "Managing member"
msgstr "Membro gerente"

#. Explanation: The English word "Address" can refer to a physical location or
#. a mailing address, while the French word "Adresse" typically refers to a

#. more general and can be used in both contexts.

#: views/views_directory.py:47

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation. The English term

#. naissance" also conveys this same meaning.
#: models.py:105 templates/members/members/member_detail.html:48
#: templates/members/members/members_directory.html:28
msgid "Birthdate"
msgstr "Data do nascimento"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that clicking on the month name or year will allow
#. for quick changes. The original English sentence is clear and concise, but
#. the French translation adds a slight nuance by using "modifier rapidement",
#. which implies making changes quickly, whereas the English sentence simply
#. says "change them quickly".
#: models.py:106
msgid "Click on the month name or the year to change them quickly"
msgstr "Clique em nome do mês ou do ano para mudá-los rapidamente"

#. Explanation: The French translation "Site web" is a compound word that

msgid "Family"
msgstr "Família"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a common way to ask about someone's identity. The English
#. phrase "Who I am" can be ambiguous, as it could also mean "What I am", but
#. in this context, the French translation makes it clear that it is asking
#. for information about the speaker's identity, and the Portuguese version
#. follows this interpretation.
#: models.py:113 templates/members/members/member_detail.html:60
msgid "Who I am"
msgstr "Quem sou"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is an invitation to describe oneself and their preferences.

msgstr "Descreva-se, seus gostos e desgostos..."

#: models.py:115
msgid "My hobbies"
msgstr "Meus hobbies"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

msgid "Provide a list of hobbies separated by commas"
msgstr "Liste os hobbies separados por vírgulas."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which explicitly mentions the concept of protecting personal life.

#. makes it clear that it's specifically about protecting personal life.
#: models.py:118
msgid "Privacy consent"
msgstr "Consentimento à proteção da vida privada"

#. Explanation: The English and French translations are identical, so the
#. Portuguese translation is also direct and literal.
#: models.py:120
msgid "Followers"
msgstr "Seguidores"

#. Explanation: The English word "member" and its French equivalent "membre"
#. have the same meaning, referring to a person who belongs to an organization
#. or group.
#: models.py:129
msgid "member"
msgstr "membro"

#. Explanation: The English and French translations are identical, suggesting
#. that the term "members" is used in a context where its meaning is already
#. clear. In Portuguese, the word "membros" can refer to members of an
#. organization or group, making it a suitable translation for this sentence.
#: models.py:130
msgid "members"
msgstr "membros"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a detailed description or information about an
#. address. The English phrase "Address Detail" is straightforward and clear,

#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:3
msgid "Address Detail"
msgstr "Detalhe da Endereço"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. English phrase "Complementary Info" is commonly used in technical and
#. business contexts to refer to such information.
#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:12
msgid "Complementary Info"
msgstr "Informações Complementares"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the address is being used or employed for
#. something. The English phrase "Address used by" can be ambiguous, as it can
#. mean both "address associated with" and "address being used". The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is an address being used, so the
#. Portuguese version "Endereço utilizado por." follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:31
msgid "Address used by:"
msgstr "Endereço utilizado por:"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the address is not being used by anyone. The
#. English phrase "Address not used by anyone" can be ambiguous, as it could
#. refer to an unused address in general or specifically to a situation where
#. no one is using it. The French translation makes it clear that it is a
#. specific case of an unused address, so the Portuguese version follows this
#. interpretation.
#: templates/members/address/address_detail.html:43
msgid "Address not used by anyone"
msgstr "Esta casa não é usada por ninguém."

#. Explanation: This translation reflects the meaning of the French phrase,
#. which is a direct and literal translation of the English word "Edit". The

msgstr "Editar"

#. Address" implies that the user wants to modify or update their address,

#: templates/members/address/address_form.html:3
#: templates/members/address/address_form.html:8
msgid "Edit Address"
msgstr "Editar endereço"

#. Explanation: The English word "Submit" can have different meanings
#. depending on the context, such as to send or to agree with. However, in
#. this case, considering the French translation "Envoyer", which implies
#. sending or transmitting, the Portuguese translation "Enviar" is consistent
#. and accurate.
#: templates/members/address/address_form.html:17
#: templates/members/family/family_form.html:17
msgid "Submit"
msgstr "Enviar"

#. Explanation: The English word "Cancel" and the French word "Annuler" both
#. convey the idea of stopping or reversing an action. In Portuguese,

msgid "Verify Email address"
msgstr "Verificar endereço de e-mail"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a specific action related to member activation. The
#. English phrase "Member Activation" is straightforward and clearly conveys

#. "Ativação de Membro" maintains this clarity and precision.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:17
msgid "Member Activation"
msgstr "Ativação de Membro"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation of the English term. The

#. e-mail" is widely accepted as a correct translation.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:21
msgid "E-mail Confirmation"
msgstr "Confirmação de E-mail"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Greetings!" is a common way to express
#. salutation, but in Portuguese, it's more common to use the word "Ossé!"
#. which is an informal way of saying "Hello" or "Hi", and can be used as a
#. greeting.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:25
msgid "Greetings!"
msgstr "Ossé!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is trying to create an account on
#. the website. The English sentence can be ambiguous, as it could also mean
#. "you received this mail because you attempted to access a restricted area"
#. or something similar. However, in the context provided by the French
#. translation, it's clear that the focus is on creating an account, so the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation.

"You received this mail because you attempted to create an account on our "
"website"
msgstr ""
"Você recebeu este e-mail porque você tentou criar uma conta no nosso site."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is polite and formal. The English sentence is a standard
#. request for users to verify their email address and activate their account
#. after signing up or registering. The French translation maintains this tone
#. and clarity, while the Portuguese version follows suit with a similar
#. structure and wording.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:28
#: tests/tests_member.py:335
msgid ""
"Please click on the link below to confirm the email and activate your "
"account."
msgstr ""

"ativar sua conta."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person will join the group immediately
#. after completing the verification process. The English sentence uses the
#. future tense "will be joining", while the French translation uses the
#. present conditional "vous rejoindrez", which implies a more immediate
#. action.
#: templates/members/email/email_verification_msg.html:31
msgid "You'll be joining us right after the verification !"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. invited. The English phrase "Hello %(invited)s, this is %(inviter)s!" can
#. be ambiguous, as it can mean both "greeting" and "introduction". The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is an introduction, so the Portuguese

#. interpretation.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the speaker created a website for managing

#. %(site_name)s website I created" is slightly ambiguous, as it could imply
#. that the speaker is inviting someone to register on any website with the
#. name "%(site_name)s". However, the French translation makes it clear that
#. the speaker has specifically created a website for this purpose. The
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation and uses the phrase "que eu

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. sentence "You can also reply to this email to contact <inviter> and check
#. with him if he really invited you..." is ambiguous, as it does not specify

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a formal registration request. The English sentence uses a

#. phrase, which indicates that the person requested to register on their
#. cousin's website. The English phrase "%(name)s (%(email)s) requested to
#. register to your cousinades site" can be ambiguous, as it uses the word
#. "cousinades", which is not a standard term in Portuguese. The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is a request to register on a specific
#. website related to cousins, so the Portuguese version follows this
#. interpretation.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a new invitation to register. The placeholder

#. %(site_name)s sent by %(inviter)s to %(invited)s" is ambiguous, as it can
#. be interpreted in different ways. However, based on the context provided by

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that there is no way to block the invitation. The
#. English sentence can be ambiguous, as it mentions not knowing or not
#. wanting someone to register on a site. However, the French translation

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a detailed description or information about the
#. family. The English phrase "Family Detail" is concise and can be
#. interpreted in different ways, but the French translation makes it clear
#. that it refers to a specific detail or aspect of the family, hence the
#. Portuguese version "Detalhe da Família".
#: templates/members/family/family_detail.html:3

#. de Famille".
#: templates/members/family/family_detail.html:9
msgid "Family name"
msgstr "Nome Familiar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the family does not have a declared parent
#. family. The English sentence can be ambiguous, as it could mean "no parent
#. family at all", but in this context, it seems to imply that there is no
#. officially recognized or declared parent family.
#: templates/members/family/family_detail.html:18
msgid "This family has no declared parent family."
msgstr "Esta família não tem uma família parental declarada."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a specific action on the family unit. The English
#. phrase "Edit Family" can be ambiguous, as it could refer to editing
#. information about families in general or specifically to editing family
#. relationships. The French translation makes it clear that it is about
#. modifying the family itself, so the Portuguese version "Editar Família"
#. follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/family/family_form.html:3
#: templates/members/family/family_form.html:8

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Sign in" is a common way to ask someone to
#. log in or authenticate themselves, whereas the French phrase "Se connecter"
#. also means to log in or connect. In this case, both translations convey the
#. same meaning and usage, so the Portuguese translation "Entrar" is used.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Need An Account?" is a common question
#. used in online applications, asking if the user already has an account. The
#. Portuguese translation "Você precisa de um conta?" maintains the same
#. meaning and tone as the original French translation "Besoin d'un compte?",
#. which also uses the formal "compte" to ask for an account.
#: templates/members/login/login.html:17
msgid "Need An Account?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is to ask for an invitation. The English phrase "Request
#. invitation link" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both requesting a link
#. and asking for an invitation. The French translation makes it clear that it
#. is asking for an invitation, so the Portuguese version "Pedir um link de
#. convite" follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/login/login.html:18
msgid "Request invitation link"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Password Forgotten?" is a common way to
#. ask if someone has forgotten their password. In Portuguese, the translation

#. phrase.
#: templates/members/login/login.html:21
#: templates/members/login/password_change.html:17
msgid "Password Forgotten?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a common way to express the concept of resetting a
#. password in many languages. The English phrase "Reset password" is also
#. widely used and understood, but the Portuguese version "Resetar senha"
#. follows the same idea as the French translation.
#: templates/members/login/login.html:22
#: templates/members/login/password_change.html:18
msgid "Reset password"
msgstr "Resetar senha"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a change in password. The English phrase "Password
#. Change" is straightforward and clear, while the French translation provides
#. more context and precision. In Portuguese, "senha" is used to refer to a
#. password, making the translation consistent with the original text.
#: templates/members/login/password_change.html:9
msgid "Password Change"
msgstr "Alteração de senha"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Password resetting" can be translated to

#. password.
#: templates/members/login/password_reset.html:9

msgid "Password Not Forgotten?"
msgstr "Senha não esquecida?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the password reset operation was completed
#. successfully. The English phrase "Password reset complete" is a standard
#. notification message used in many systems, and its translation to
#. Portuguese should convey the same sense of completion and success.
#: templates/members/login/password_reset_complete.html:6
msgid "Password reset complete"
msgstr "Senha reiniciada com sucesso"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the password has been set and the user can now
#. log in. The English sentence is written in a formal tone, suggesting an
#. automated system or a notification, while the French translation maintains
#. this tone.

#. confirmed. The Portuguese version maintains this clarity and precision.
#: templates/members/login/password_reset_confirm.html:11
msgid "Password reset confirmation"
msgstr "Confirmação de reinicialização do senha"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which emphasizes the importance of verifying that the user has
#. entered their new password correctly. The English sentence is somewhat
#. ambiguous, as it could be interpreted as simply asking for confirmation
#. without emphasizing the need to verify correctness.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a change to the user's password. The English phrase
#. "Change my password" is clear and direct, while the French translation uses
#. more formal language to convey the same idea. In Portuguese, we use the
#. verb "alterar" to indicate a change or modification, making it consistent
#. with the French translation.
#: templates/members/login/password_reset_confirm.html:17
msgid "Change my password"
msgstr "Alterar minha senha."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the password reset link is invalid and may
#. have already been used by someone else. The English sentence provides
#. additional context to clarify this, so the Portuguese version "O link de
#. resetar senha foi inválido, possivelmente porque já foi usado. Por favor,
#. solicite uma nova resetar senha." follows this interpretation.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a password reset was successfully sent. The
#. English phrase "Password reset sent" is straightforward and implies that
#. the action has been completed. The French translation makes it clear that
#. the password reset was initiated, so the Portuguese version "Mot de passe
#. reinitialisé" follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/login/password_reset_done.html:6
msgid "Password reset sent"
msgstr "Mot de passe reinitialisé"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which provides instructions for setting a password and explains
#. that they will be sent shortly if an account exists with the provided email
#. address. The English sentence is slightly ambiguous, as it uses "We've
#. emailed" which can imply that the action happened in the past, but the

#. Explanation: The English term "Birthdays" can refer to the anniversary of

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. "birthdays that will occur within a certain timeframe" and "upcoming
#. birthdays". The French translation makes it clear that it is about upcoming

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Export Members" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, but the context of the French translation "Exportation de
#. Membres" suggests that it refers to exporting members or data from a group
#. or organization. The Portuguese translation "Exportar Membros" follows this
#. interpretation, indicating that the action is related to exporting members
#. or data.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:7
msgid "Export Members"
msgstr "Exportar Membros"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user can export members to a CSV file and
#. provides additional context about the structure of the exported file.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:9

"You can export members to a CSV file. The first line of the file contains "
"the field names. "
msgstr ""
"Você pode exportar membros para um arquivo CSV. A primeira linha do arquivo "
"contém os nomes dos campos."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that all fields are present and empty if they are
#. not present in the database. The original English sentence is a bit
#. ambiguous, but the French translation makes it clear that "present" refers
#. to being in the database, so the Portuguese version follows this
#. interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:10
msgid "All fields are present and empty if not present in the database. "
msgstr ""
"Todos os campos estão presentes e vazios se não estiverem presentes na base "

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that administrators can re-import files after
#. making modifications with any CSV editor. The English sentence is clear and

msgstr ""
"Administradores podem reimportar os arquivos após a modificação com qualquer"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation. The English phrase
#. "Select members to export" can be slightly rephrased in Portuguese as
#. "Selecione os membros para exportar", maintaining the same meaning and tone
#. as the original sentence.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:18
msgid "Select members to export"
msgstr "Selecione os membros para exportar"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Family filter" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, but the context of the French translation "Filtre sur la
#. Famille" suggests that it refers to a setting or option related to family
#. content. In this case, the Portuguese translation "Filtra de Família"
#. maintains the same meaning and connotation as the original English phrase.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:21
msgid "Family filter"
msgstr "Filtra de Família"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a filter for cities. The English phrase "City
#. filter" is more general and could refer to any type of filter, whereas the
#. French translation makes it clear that it's specifically for cities, so the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:26
msgid "City filter"
msgstr "Filtra pela Cidade"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a filtering or sorting by last name. The English
#. phrase "Last name filter" suggests a specific action being taken on the
#. last names, whereas the French and Portuguese translations imply a more
#. general concept of filtering or sorting by this criterion.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:31
msgid "Last name filter"
msgstr "Filtra por último nome"

#. Explanation: The English word "export" and the French word "exporter" both
#. convey the idea of sending or transferring something out of a country, but
#. in this case, the translations are identical.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:40
msgid "Export"
msgstr "Exportar"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Select a name" can be interpreted as both
#. selecting an option and choosing a person's name. However, the French
#. translation "Selectionner un nom" makes it clear that the context is about
#. choosing a name, which aligns with the Portuguese translation "Escolher um
#. nome".
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:51
msgid "Select a name..."
msgstr "Escolher um nome..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Select a city..." is often used in the
#. context of selecting a location, and the French translation "Selectionner
#. une ville..." accurately conveys this meaning. In Portuguese, the verb
#. "selecionar" means to select or choose, and adding the definite article
#. "uma" before the noun "cidade" makes the sentence grammatically correct and
#. idiomatic.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:55
msgid "Select a city..."
msgstr "Selecione uma cidade..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Select a family" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, but the French translation makes it clear that the context
#. is about selecting or choosing a family. In Portuguese, the verb
#. "selecionar" (to select) is used to convey this meaning, resulting in the
#. translation "Selecione uma família...".
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:59
msgid "Select a family..."
msgstr "Selecione uma família..."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the selection should be cleared. The English
#. phrase "Clear selection" is a common instruction in user interfaces, and
#. the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/export_members.html:85
msgid "Clear selection"
msgstr "Seleção clara"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that importing members from a CSV file is allowed
#. and provides instructions on how to format the first line of the file. The
#. English sentence is clear about the requirement for the field names, while
#. the French translation makes it explicit by using the word "doit" (must)
#. and providing more detail with the phrase "comme décrit ci-dessous" (as
#. described below).
#: templates/members/members/import_members.html:8
msgid ""
"You can import members from a CSV file. The first line of the file must "
"contain the field names as described below."
msgstr ""
"Você pode importar membros de um arquivo CSV. A primeira linha do arquivo "
"deve conter os nomes dos campos como descrito abaixo."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the file must contain a minimum number of
#. specified columns. The English sentence is clear and direct, while the
#. French translation adds a more formal tone with "doit contenir", which
#. means "must contain".
#: templates/members/members/import_members.html:13
msgid "The file must contain at least these columns:"
msgstr "O arquivo deve conter pelo menos essas colunas:"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that it is possible to add optional columns. The
#. English sentence uses a more informal tone, while the French translation
#. maintains a formal tone, so the Portuguese version follows this formal
#. interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/import_members.html:16
msgid "You can also add these optional columns:"
msgstr "Você também pode adicionar essas colunas opcionais."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that avatar names should be image file names. The
#. English sentence is clear and direct about the requirement for avatar names
#. to be image file names, so the Portuguese version follows this
#. interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/import_members.html:19
msgid "Avatars must be image file names."
msgstr "Os avatares devem ser nomes de arquivos de imagem."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the files must be uploaded manually before
#. being placed in the avatars folder. The English sentence uses a placeholder
#. for the media root directory, which is preserved in the Portuguese
#. translation to maintain consistency with the original context.
#: templates/members/members/import_members.html:20
#, python-format
msgid ""
"They must be uploaded manually first in the avatars folders of the "
"%(media_root)s folder."

"%(media_root)s."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the date of birth must be provided in a
#. specific format. The English phrase "The date of birth must be entered in
#. the format YYYY/MM/DD" suggests that the format should include four digits
#. for the year, two digits for the month, and two digits for the day. The
#. French translation makes it clear that this is the expected format, so the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/import_members.html:23
msgid "The date of birth must be entered in the format YYYY/MM/DD."
msgstr "O dia do nascimento deve ser inserido no formato AAAA/MM/JJ."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. Explanation: The English word "Import" and its French equivalent "Importer"
#. both convey the idea of bringing something into a system or country, often
#. with regulatory or financial implications. In Portuguese, the translation
#. "Importar" accurately captures this meaning.
#: templates/members/members/import_members.html:33
msgid "Import"
msgstr "Importar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a detailed description or information about a
#. member. The English phrase "Member Detail" is straightforward and implies a
#. summary or overview of a member's details, while the French translation
#. makes it clear that it is a more specific and detailed description.
#: templates/members/members/member_detail.html:3
msgid "Member Detail"
msgstr "Detalhe do Membro"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is an active member. The English
#. phrase "Active member" can be ambiguous, but in this context, it clearly
#. conveys the idea of being actively involved or engaged as a member.
#: templates/members/members/member_detail.html:25
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:23 tests/tests_member.py:242
msgid "Active member"
msgstr "Membro ativo"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person is a managed member. The English
#. phrase "Managed member" can be ambiguous, as it can refer to a member who
#. has been assigned or delegated certain responsibilities. The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is a managed member, so the Portuguese
#. version "Membro gerido" follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/member_detail.html:27
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:25 tests/tests_member.py:242
msgid "Managed member"
msgstr "Membro gerido"

#. Explanation: The English word "Email" is a common term for electronic mail,
#. and its Portuguese equivalent "Correio eletrônico" conveys the same
#. meaning.

#: templates/members/members/members_directory.html:30
#: views/views_directory.py:47
msgid "Email"
msgstr "Correio eletrônico"

#. Explanation: The English word "Hobbies" refers to activities or interests
#. pursued in one's free time. In Portuguese, the translation "Atividades" is
#. more literal and conveys a similar meaning, but it can also imply a sense
#. of leisure or recreational pursuits.
#: templates/members/members/member_detail.html:64
msgid "Hobbies"
msgstr "Atividades"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that only a specific person (the one with the name
#. specified by the placeholder) can manage this member. The English sentence
#. is ambiguous, as it could be interpreted in different ways, but the French
#. translation makes it clear that it's about a specific person having
#. exclusive management rights.
#: templates/members/members/member_detail.html:81
#, python-format
msgid "(Only %(name)s can manage this member)"
msgstr "(Só %(name)s pode gerenciar este membro)"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a common way to express the idea of changing one's
#. password in many contexts. The English phrase "Change Password" is also
#. widely used and understood in this sense.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:35
msgid "Change Password"
msgstr "Alterar Senha"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation. The English phrase
#. "Activate Account" can be slightly ambiguous, but in this context, it
#. clearly means to activate an existing account, making the Portuguese
#. version "Ativar Conta" a suitable translation.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:40
msgid "Activate Account"
msgstr "Ativar Conta"

#. Explanation: The English word "Delete" can have different meanings
#. depending on the context, such as deleting a file or deleting an account.
#. However, in general, it means to remove or get rid of something. The
#. Portuguese translation "Apagar" is more neutral and can be used in various
#. contexts, making it a suitable choice for this sentence.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:43
msgid "Delete"
msgstr "Apagar"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Remove my account" can be ambiguous, as it
#. could refer to removing a user's account from a service or platform.
#. However, the French translation "Supprimer mon compte" makes it clear that
#. it is referring to deleting a personal account. In Portuguese, we use the
#. term "perfil" instead of "compte", which also implies a personal account.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:47
msgid "Remove my account"
msgstr "Remova meu perfil."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the action is to remove or delete a member.
#. The English phrase "Delete member" can be ambiguous, as it can refer to
#. various contexts such as deleting a user account or removing a person from
#. a group. The French translation makes it clear that it is about removing a
#. specific entity (le Membre), so the Portuguese version "Apagar membro"
#. follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:49
msgid "Delete member"
msgstr "Apagar membro"

#. Explanation: The English word "Update" can have different meanings, such as
#. to make something new or recent, or to install software. In this context,
#. the Portuguese translation "Atualizar" is more literal and idiomatic,
#. conveying the idea of updating or modifying something.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:65
#: templates/members/modal_form.html:27
msgid "Update"
msgstr "Atualizar"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. word, which is a verb that means to create or make something. The English
#. word "Create" also has this same meaning, so the Portuguese version "Criar"
#. follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:68
#: templates/members/modal_form.html:23
msgid "Create"
msgstr "Crear"

#. Explanation: The English phrase is a question asking if the user has lost
#. their verification email. The French translation makes it clear that it's a
#. question, and the Portuguese version maintains this tone while using the
#. correct verb conjugation to convey the same meaning.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:75
msgid "Lost your verification email?"
msgstr "Você perdeu seu e-mail de verificação?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is to ask for or request something. In this context, it means
#. to ask for a new link, which is a common request in many situations, such
#. as when a user wants to access a webpage that has been removed or changed.

#: templates/members/registration/email_verification_failed.html:13
msgid "Request a new link"
msgstr "Pedir um novo link"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a new address has been created. The English
#. phrase "Address created" is straightforward and implies the creation of a
#. new address, so the Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:83
msgid "Address created"
msgstr "Endereço criado"

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same meaning and tone
#. as the original English phrase, using the word "nova" to indicate a new
#. address.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:85
msgid "New Address"
msgstr "Nova Endereço"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the address has been updated. The English
#. phrase "Address updated" is a common way to describe this action in an
#. informal context, while the Portuguese version "Endereço atualizado"
#. follows the formal and more precise equivalent used in official contexts.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:90
msgid "Address updated"
msgstr "Endereço atualizado"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a change to be made. The English phrase "Change
#. Address" can imply both changing an address and modifying it, while the
#. French translation makes it clear that it is about making changes to an
#. existing address.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:92
msgid "Change Address"
msgstr "Alterar Endereço"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a family was created or established. The
#. English phrase "Family created" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "a
#. family came into existence" and "family members were created", but in this
#. context, it seems to imply the former.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:97
msgid "Family created"
msgstr "Família criou."

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation maintains the same meaning and tone
#. as the French original, using the word "nova" to indicate a new family.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:99
msgid "New Family"
msgstr "Nova Família"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a parent family was created. The English
#. phrase "Parent family created" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "a
#. family with parents" and "the creation of a family". The French translation
#. makes it clear that it is a family with parents, so the Portuguese version
#. "Família parental criou" follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:102
msgid "Parent family created"
msgstr "Família parental criou"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a family with new parents. The English phrase "New
#. Parent Family" can be ambiguous, as it can refer to either a family with
#. new parents or a support group for new parents. The French translation
#. makes it clear that it is a family with new parents, so the Portuguese
#. version "Nova Família de Pais" follows this interpretation.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:104
msgid "New Parent Family"
msgstr "Nova Família de Pais"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Family updated" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, but the context of the French translation "Famille mise à
#. jour" suggests that it refers to updating a family's information or data.
#. In Portuguese, this is translated as "Família atualizada", which maintains
#. the same meaning and connotation as the original English phrase.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:109
msgid "Family updated"
msgstr "Família atualizada"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a change or modification to the family. The English
#. phrase "Change Family" can be interpreted as changing one's own family or
#. altering the concept of family in general, while the French translation
#. makes it clear that it is about modifying an existing family unit.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:111
msgid "Change Family"
msgstr "Alterar a Família"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the username is already taken. The English
#. phrase "This username is not available!" suggests that it's currently

#. about the current availability of the username.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:121
msgid "This username is not available!"
msgstr "Este nome de usuário não está disponível!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a more polite and formal way to ask if someone wants to
#. delete their account. The English phrase "Delete My Account" can be direct
#. and blunt, whereas the French translation adds a question mark at the end,
#. making it more considerate and inviting.
#: templates/members/members/member_upsert.html:127
msgid "Delete My Account"
msgstr "Apagar meu perfil."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a warning about the permanent deletion of an account and

msgstr "Apagar Membro"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a confirmation question about deleting an account and its
#. associated data. The English sentence uses a placeholder for the name,
#. while the French translation explicitly mentions "le compte" (the account),

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Members List" can be ambiguous, as it
#. could refer to a list of members in an organization or a list of people who
#. are part of a group. However, the French translation "Liste des Membres"
#. suggests that it is a specific list of members, likely within a particular
#. context such as a company or club. The Portuguese translation "Lista de

msgid "Members List"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the action is to show or display the
#. directory. The English phrase "Show directory" is a direct and literal
#. translation, while the French phrase uses the verb "afficher", which
#. implies a more formal or official context, but in this case, it's used in
#. an informal way to simply indicate showing something.

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Filter Members" can be interpreted in

#. Explanation: The English term "first name" refers to the person's given or

#: templates/members/members/members.html:29

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. members.

#: templates/members/members/members_directory.html:50
msgid "No members found"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Members Directory" refers to a list or
#. catalog of members, while the French phrase "Annuaire des Membres"
#. specifically indicates that it is an annual directory. In Portuguese, we

#. Explanation: The English word "Print" and the French word "Imprimer" both
#. convey the idea of producing a physical copy or output, but in different
#. contexts. In English, "print" can also mean to display on a screen (e.g.,
#. print a document). However, in this context, with the translation
#. "Imprimer", it's clear that the focus is on producing a physical copy,
#. which aligns with the French meaning of "imprimer".
#: templates/members/members/members_directory.html:13
msgid "Print"
msgstr "Imprimir"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Print as PDF" is commonly used to instruct
#. software or systems to print a document in Portable Document Format (PDF),
#. which preserves its layout and formatting. The Portuguese translation

#. phrase, which indicates that the person or entity (the link) has lived its
#. life and is now dead. The English phrase "The link has lived its life :(

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates requesting a new link. The English phrase "Request
#. Another one" can be interpreted as both requesting something in general and
#. specifically asking for another instance of something. The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is about requesting a new link, so the
#. Portuguese version "Pedir outro" follows this interpretation.

msgid "Request Another one"
msgstr "Pedir outro"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "New Email Sent" can be interpreted as
#. either a notification that a new email has been sent or an action of

#. in digital communication.

msgid "You have requested another verification email!"
msgstr "Você solicitou outro e-mail de verificação!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation. The English phrase
#. "Invite Members" can be interpreted as an invitation to join or participate

#. inviting members, likely to a group or organization.
#: templates/members/registration/registration_invite.html:3

msgid "Invite Members"
msgstr "Convidar Membros"

#. Explanation: The English word "Invite" can have different meanings, such as
#. to ask someone to a party or to suggest something. However, the French

#. is consistent with the most common usage of the word in both languages.

#. Explanation: The Portuguese translation "Convidem-me" is a formal way of
#. saying "Invite me". In informal contexts, it would be more common to use
#. "Convide-me" or simply "Conviça-me", but in formal situations, the verb
#. conjugation used here is more suitable.
#: templates/members/registration/registration_request.html:15

msgid "Request New Email"
msgstr "Pedir um novo e-mail"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the action is to modify or change the selected
#. items. The English phrase "Change selected %(name)s" can be ambiguous, as
#. it can refer to changing a specific item or category, but the French
#. translation makes it clear that it's about modifying the selection itself.

msgstr "Alterar os %(name)s selecionados"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates adding another item. The English phrase "Add
#. another %(translated_name)s" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "adding
#. a new name" and "adding another name". The French translation makes it
#. clear that it is about adding another item, so the Portuguese version "%s
#. adiciona outro %s" follows this interpretation.

msgstr "Adicionar mais %(translated_name)s"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Member deleted" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, but the context of the French translation "Membre supprimé"
#. suggests that it is referring to a member being removed or excluded from
#. something. In Portuguese, the translation "Membro excluído" maintains this
#. meaning and conveys a sense of removal or exclusion.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that only superusers have the permission to invite
#. members. The English sentence is a statement of restriction, implying that

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

msgstr "Registro de solicitação enviada."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a member with the same email address already

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Invalid CAPTCHA" can be ambiguous, as it
#. could also mean that the CAPTCHA is not valid in a certain context.
#. However, based on the French translation "CAPTCHA invalide", which implies
#. that the CAPTCHA itself is invalid or incorrect, the Portuguese translation
#. "CAPTCHA inválido" follows this interpretation.

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the link is invalid and needs to be reported
#. to the administrator. The English phrase "Invalid link. Please contact the

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a member is already active. The English phrase
#. "Error: Member already active" can be ambiguous, as it could also indicate
#. an error in the activation process. However, based on the context provided
#. by the French translation, it seems to suggest that the member's status is
#. already active, making the Portuguese translation "Erro: Membro já ativo" a
#. suitable interpretation.
#: views/views_activate.py:25
msgid "Error: Member already active"
msgstr "Erro: Membro já ativo"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a member without an email address cannot be
#. activated. The English phrase "Error: Member without email cannot be
#. activated" is clear and concise, but the French translation makes it
#. explicit that the issue is with the absence of an email address, so the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation.
#: views/views_activate.py:27
msgid "Error: Member without email cannot be activated"
msgstr "Erro: Membro sem e-mail não pode ser ativado"

#. Explanation: This translation reflects the meaning of the French phrase,
#. which indicates that the account has been successfully activated and the
#. owner will receive an email with an activation link. The English sentence
#. can be ambiguous, as it mentions "password reset screen", which could imply
#. that the password needs to be reset before activation. However, the context
#. translation makes it clear that the activation process is complete, and the
#. password reset step occurs afterwards.
#: views/views_activate.py:31

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French

#. translating the text.
#: views/views_followers.py:24
#, python-format
msgid "You are no longer following %(followed_name)s"
msgstr "Já não está a seguir %(followed_name)s"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the action of following is still ongoing. The
#. English sentence implies a change in the state of following, while the
#. French and Portuguese translations convey the idea that the person is still
#. following the specified individual.

msgid "You have a new follower!"
msgstr "Você tem um novo seguidor!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the person has started to follow the other
#. person. The English phrase "%(follower_name)s is now following you!"
#. suggests a notification or an action taken by the follower, while the

#. established between the two parties.

#. phrase, which indicates that there is an unknown column in a CSV file. The

#. lists the mandatory fields. The English sentence "Missing column in CSV
#. file: "%(fieldname)s". Mandatory fields are %(all_names)s" can be
#. ambiguous, as it can mean both "missing column" and "mandatory fields", but

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Warning: %(error)s" and the French phrase
#. "Attention: %(error)s" both indicate a warning or an alert, but with
#. slightly different connotations. In English, "warning" can imply a more
#. formal or official notice, while in French, "attention" is often used to

#. Explanation: The English phrase "My Profile" can be interpreted as both a
