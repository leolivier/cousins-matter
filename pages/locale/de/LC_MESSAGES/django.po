#. Explanation: The English word "pages" is directly transliterated into the

#. explanation.

msgid "Pages"
msgstr "Seiten"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that a flatpage with the specified URL
#. already exists.  The use of "eine Flatpage" and "der URL" maintains
#. consistency with the original sentence's structure.

#, python-format
msgid "Flatpage with url %(url)s already exists"
msgstr "Eine Flatpage mit der URL %(url)s existiert bereits"

#. Explanation: The French translation clarifies that a flatpage cannot be a
#. subpage of another flatpage.  The German translation maintains this meaning
#. and uses the appropriate word "Unterseite" for "subpage".
#: forms.py:38 tests/tests_crud.py:39
msgid "A flatpage cannot be a subpage of another flatpage, check your URLs"
msgstr ""
"Eine Flatpage kann keine Unterseite einer anderen Flatpage sein; überprüfe "
"deine URLs."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Update Page" is translated into German as
#. "Aktualisiere Seite".  This accurately reflects the meaning of the original
#. English phrase.

#: templates/pages/page_form.html:27
msgid "Update Page"
msgstr "Aktualisiere Seite"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Create Page" is translated directly into
#. German as "Erstelle Seite". This accurately reflects the meaning and intent
#. of both the English and French phrases.  The use of "Seite" (page) in
#. German maintains a consistent and accurate translation for the concept of
#. creating a page.

#: templates/pages/pages_admin_list.html:11
msgid "Create Page"
msgstr "Erstelle Seite"

#. Explanation: The German translation captures the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates saving the page and continuing editing.  The
#. English phrase "Save Page and Continue Editing" can be ambiguous as it
#. could mean either saving the page and then returning to edit or just
#. continuing with the current edits.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:33
msgid "Save Page and Continue Editing"
msgstr "Speichern der Seite und Fortfahren mit Bearbeiten"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Delete Page" is translated into German as
#. "Löschen Seite". This translates the meaning of the original phrase, which
#. refers to deleting a page.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:37 templates/pages/page_form.html:44
msgid "Delete Page"
msgstr "Löschen Seite"

#. **Explanation:** 
#. The provided English sentence is asking if the user is sure about deleting
#. a specific page. The French translation accurately captures this meaning
#. and uses the placeholder `%(title)s` to refer to the actual title of the
#. page.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:45
#, python-format
msgid "Are you sure you want to delete the page \"%(title)s\"?"
msgstr "Sind Sie sicher, dass Sie die Seite \"%(title)s\" löschen möchten?"

#. Explanation:  The English phrase "Pages Tree" is a common way to refer to a
#. hierarchical structure of pages, often used in web development or document
#. management. The French translation "Arbre des Pages" directly translates
#. this meaning into the French language.
#: templates/pages/page_tree.html:3 templates/pages/page_tree.html:7
msgid "Pages Tree"
msgstr "Seitenbaum"

#. **Explanation:**  The French translation accurately conveys the meaning of
#. the English sentence, and I have translated it into German while preserving
#. the original meaning and tone. The use of "Kann die Seite nicht laden" is a
#. more literal translation of "Cannot load the page", which is appropriate
#. for this context.
#: templatetags/pages_tags.py:102
#, python-brace-format
msgid ""
"Cannot load page from url {url}, it was not found in the database. Please "
"contact the administrator of the site"
msgstr ""
"Kann die Seite nicht von der URL {url} laden, sie wurde im Datenbank nicht "
"gefunden. Bitte kontaktieren Sie den Administrator des Websites"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that a page has been saved.  The use of
#. "Seite" and "gespeichert" maintains consistency with the original
#. sentence's structure and conveys the same information as the French
#. translation.
#: views.py:28 views.py:47
#, python-format
msgid "Page \"%(title)s\" saved"
msgstr "Seite \"%(title)s\" gespeichert"

#. Explanation: The German translation accurately reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates that the page has been deleted.  The use of
#. "(title)s" in both the English and French translations is a placeholder for
#. the actual title of the page.
