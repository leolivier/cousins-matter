#. Explanation: The English word "Pages" is a common noun that can mean
#. different things depending on the context. In this case, both the original
#. and the contextual translations are identical to "Pages," which suggests it
#. refers to pages in a document or book. Therefore, the Spanish translation
#. remains as "Páginas." There is no need for further explanation as the words
#. match directly between English and Spanish in this simple context.

msgid "Pages"
msgstr "Páginas"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the provided English and French sentences. The placeholders in both
#. original texts are maintained as they appear, ensuring that the context is
#. preserved. The structure "Flatpage with url %(url)s already exists" from
#. the English sentence becomes "Flatpage con el url %(url)s ya existe" in
#. Spanish, which maintains the same meaning as the French translation "Une
#. page avec l'url %(url)s existe déjà."
#: forms.py:34 tests/tests_crud.py:31 tests/tests_crud.py:78
#, python-format
msgid "Flatpage with url %(url)s already exists"
msgstr "Flatpage con el url %(url)s ya existe"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the provided French sentence. The key terms and their meanings are
#. preserved:
#. - "flatpage" is translated as "flatpage"
#. - "cannot be a subpage of another flatpage" becomes "no puede ser una
#. subpágina de otra flatpage"
#. - "check your URLs" translates to "verifica tus URL"
#. The structure and grammar in Spanish maintain the original meaning and
#. intent of the English sentence.
#: forms.py:38 tests/tests_crud.py:39
msgid "A flatpage cannot be a subpage of another flatpage, check your URLs"
msgstr ""
"A flatpage no puede ser una subpágina de otra flatpage, verifica tus URL."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Update Page" can be interpreted in two
#. ways. It could mean to update the content of a webpage, or it could imply
#. making changes to the layout or design of a page. Given the French
#. translation which uses "Mettre à jour," this suggests that the primary
#. meaning is to make updates or adjustments rather than just updating the
#. content. Therefore, the Spanish translation "Mantener la página
#. actualizada" reflects this interpretation by emphasizing keeping the page
#. up-to-date in terms of both content and design.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:5 templates/pages/page_form.html:17
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:27
msgid "Update Page"
msgstr "Mantener la página actualizada"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase,
#. maintaining both the meaning and structure of the original. The term "Page"
#. in English is translated as "Página" in Spanish, which accurately reflects
#. this context.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:7 templates/pages/page_form.html:19
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:29 templates/pages/pages_admin_list.html:9
#: templates/pages/pages_admin_list.html:11
msgid "Create Page"
msgstr "Criar una Página"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the English phrase "Save Page and Continue Editing." The French translation
#. "Enregistrer la page et continuer l'édition" is a direct equivalent,
#. indicating that the action involves saving a document or webpage
#. (enregistrer) and then continuing to edit it (continuer avec l'édition).
#. The Spanish version maintains this meaning by using similar verbs: guardar
#. (to save) and continuar con la edición (to continue with the editing).
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:33
msgid "Save Page and Continue Editing"
msgstr "Guardar la página y continuar con la edición"

#. Explanation: This translation directly corresponds to the French phrase,
#. which is "Supprimer la Page." The English term "Delete Page" can be
#. interpreted as either deleting a page or making a deletion of a page. In
#. this context, "Supprimer la Page" clearly indicates that the action
#. involves removing or erasing a page, so "Eliminar la Página," which means
#. "to delete the page," is the most accurate translation.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:37 templates/pages/page_form.html:44
msgid "Delete Page"
msgstr "Eliminar la Página"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the provided French sentence. The structure and phrasing are maintained,
#. with "es-tu sûr" (Are you sure) translated to "eres seguro" in a more
#. formal tone that matches the original's level of formality. The placeholder
#. "%(title)s" is kept intact as it represents the title of the page being
#. referred to.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:45
#, python-format
msgid "Are you sure you want to delete the page \"%(title)s\"?"
msgstr "Eres seguro de querer eliminar la página '%(title)s'?"

#. Explanation: The English term "Pages Tree" is ambiguous and could refer to
#. a tree-like structure of pages or a directory structure. Given the French
#. context translation "Arbre des Pages," which directly translates to "Arbre
#. de las Páginas" in Spanish, it's clear that we are dealing with a directory
#. structure or hierarchical system of files or web pages. Therefore, the most
#. appropriate and consistent translation is "Arbres de las Páginas." However,
#. since "Pages Tree" is commonly understood as referring to a directory
#. structure, "Arbre des Pages" is more fitting in this context.
#: templates/pages/page_tree.html:3 templates/pages/page_tree.html:7
msgid "Pages Tree"
msgstr "Arbre de las Páginas"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the provided French sentence. The placeholders in both sentences are
#. maintained as they were in the original text to ensure consistency and
#. context preservation. The key elements such as "Cannot load page," "url
#. {url}," "not found in the database," and "Please contact" are translated
#. accordingly, maintaining the same structure and intent.
#: templatetags/pages_tags.py:102
#, python-brace-format
msgid ""
"Cannot load page from url {url}, it was not found in the database. Please "
"contact the administrator of the site"
msgstr ""
"No se puede cargar la página desde el URL {url}, no fue encontrada en la "
"base de datos. Por favor, contacte al administrador del sitio"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation accurately reflects the meaning of
#. the French phrase, which indicates that a page has been registered or
#. saved. The placeholder format is maintained as in the original sentence and
#. translation, ensuring consistency with the user's instructions.
#: views.py:28 views.py:47
#, python-format
msgid "Page \"%(title)s\" saved"
msgstr "Page '%(title)s' registrada"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the structure and meaning
#. of the original English sentence, including the placeholder format. The
#. French translation "Page '%(title)s' supprimée" directly corresponds to
#. this structure, indicating that a page has been deleted. Therefore,
#. "eliminada" is used in its place, which accurately reflects the action of
#. deletion in Spanish.
#: views.py:68
#, python-format
msgid "Page \"%(title)s\" deleted"
msgstr "Page '%(title)s' eliminada"
