#. Explanation: The English and French translations are identical, suggesting
#. that the term "Pages" is used in both languages to refer to a unit of
#. written content. In Portuguese, this translation is consistent with the
#. French version, using the word "páginas" to convey the same meaning.
#: apps.py:8 templates/pages/menu_pages.html:4
#: templates/pages/pages_admin_list.html:3
#: templates/pages/pages_admin_list.html:8
msgid "Pages"
msgstr "Páginas"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a flat page with the given URL already exists.
#. The English sentence uses a placeholder for the URL, while the French
#. translation includes it in the sentence. The Portuguese version maintains
#. this format to preserve the original context and clarity.
#: forms.py:34 tests/tests_crud.py:31 tests/tests_crud.py:78
#, python-format
msgid "Flatpage with url %(url)s already exists"
msgstr "Pagina plana com url %(url)s já existe"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a flatpage cannot be a subpage of another
#. flatpage. The English sentence is warning against this possibility and
#. advising to check the URLs, so the Portuguese version "verifique suas URLs"
#. maintains the same tone and advice.
#: forms.py:38 tests/tests_crud.py:39
msgid "A flatpage cannot be a subpage of another flatpage, check your URLs"
msgstr ""
"Uma página de flatpage não pode ser uma sub página de outra página de "
"flatpage, verifique suas URLs."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a common way to express updating or refreshing a webpage.
#. The English phrase "Update Page" can be interpreted in different ways, but
#. the French and Portuguese translations convey the idea of making changes to
#. a page, which is consistent with the original meaning.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:5 templates/pages/page_form.html:17
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:27
msgid "Update Page"
msgstr "Atualizar Página"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a direct and literal translation. The English phrase
#. "Create Page" can be interpreted in different ways, but the French
#. translation makes it clear that the action is to create a new page.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:7 templates/pages/page_form.html:19
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:29 templates/pages/pages_admin_list.html:9
#: templates/pages/pages_admin_list.html:11
msgid "Create Page"
msgstr "Criar Página"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates saving a page and continuing to edit it. The
#. English phrase is clear in its intention, and the Portuguese version
#. follows this interpretation.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:33
msgid "Save Page and Continue Editing"
msgstr "Salvar Página e Continuar Editando"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Delete Page" can be interpreted in
#. different ways, such as deleting a page from a document or deleting a
#. webpage. However, the French translation "Supprimer la Page" makes it clear
#. that the action is to delete a specific page. In Portuguese, we use the
#. word "Página" to refer to a web page, so the translation "Apagar Página"
#. follows this interpretation.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:37 templates/pages/page_form.html:44
msgid "Delete Page"
msgstr "Apagar Página"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is asking if the user is sure they want to delete a specific
#. page. The English sentence uses a placeholder for the page title, and the
#. French translation also uses this placeholder. The Portuguese version
#. maintains the same format and places the placeholder in the same location
#. as in the original sentence.
#: templates/pages/page_form.html:45
#, python-format
msgid "Are you sure you want to delete the page \"%(title)s\"?"
msgstr "Você está seguro de querer apagar a página '%(title)s'?"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which is a literal and poetic description of a tree with pages or
#. leaves. The English phrase "Pages Tree" can be ambiguous, as it could refer
#. to a book or a collection of pages, but in this context, the French
#. translation suggests a more figurative meaning, where the tree represents a
#. repository of knowledge or stories.
#: templates/pages/page_tree.html:3 templates/pages/page_tree.html:7
msgid "Pages Tree"
msgstr "Árvore das Páginas"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the page could not be loaded from the provided
#. URL because it was not found in the database. The English sentence is
#. somewhat formal and uses a more polite tone, while the French translation
#. maintains this politeness with "Merci" (thank you).
#: templatetags/pages_tags.py:102
#, python-brace-format
msgid ""
"Cannot load page from url {url}, it was not found in the database. Please "
"contact the administrator of the site"
msgstr ""
"Não é possível carregar a página do URL {url}, ela não foi encontrada na "
"base de dados. Por favor, entre em contato com o administrador do site."

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a page has been saved. The English phrase
#. "Page "%(title)s" saved" can be ambiguous, as it can mean both "saving a
#. page with a specific title" and "saving a page in general". The French
#. translation makes it clear that it is saving a page, so the Portuguese
#. version follows this interpretation.
#: views.py:28 views.py:47
#, python-format
msgid "Page \"%(title)s\" saved"
msgstr "página '%(title)s' salva"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a page was deleted. The English phrase "Page
#. "%(title)s" deleted" uses a placeholder for the title of the page, and the
#. Portuguese version follows this interpretation by using the same
#. placeholder.
#: views.py:68
#, python-format
msgid "Page \"%(title)s\" deleted"
msgstr "página '%(title)s' excluída"
