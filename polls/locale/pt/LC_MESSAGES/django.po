#. Explanation: The English term "polls" can refer to both the act of
#. surveying people and the results of such a survey. In this context, the
#. Portuguese translation "pesquisas" is more general and encompasses both
#. meanings, whereas in French, "sondages" specifically refers to the act of
#. surveying.
